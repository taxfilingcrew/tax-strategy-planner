    summary:
      'Entity-choice analysis for multi-owner businesses: partnership (Form ' +
      '1065) versus S corporation (Form 1120-S). The S corp wins the ' +
      'employment-tax comparison — only reasonable comp bears FICA, while a ' +
      'general partner\'s guaranteed payments AND distributive share of ' +
      'ordinary business income are generally SE-taxed in full (§1402(a); ' +
      '§707(c); Rev. Rul. 69-184 — partners cannot be W-2 employees of their ' +
      'partnership). The partnership wins nearly everything else: special ' +
      'allocations under §704(b), outside basis from entity-level debt under ' +
      '§752 (S shareholders get debt basis only for direct shareholder loans, ' +
      '§1366(d)), §754/§743(b) inside-basis step-ups on transfers and death, ' +
      'tax-free property distributions (§731 vs. §311(b) gain recognition for ' +
      'S corps), and no reasonable-compensation exam exposure. The right ' +
      'answer is fact-driven; this advisory frames the tradeoffs, and the ' +
      'S-Corp Election strategy models the employment-tax side.',
    mechanics: [
      'Employment tax: an S-corp owner pays FICA only on W-2 reasonable comp; ' +
      'distributions escape it (Rev. Rul. 59-221). A general partner pays SE ' +
      'tax on guaranteed payments (§707(c)) and on the full distributive ' +
      'share of trade-or-business income (§1402(a)). The §1402(a)(13) ' +
      'limited-partner exclusion does not rescue ACTIVE owners: the Tax Court ' +
      '(Renkemeyer; Soroban, 161 T.C. 310 (2023)) looks at what the partner ' +
      'does, and in 2026 two courts of appeals agreed that the state-law ' +
      'label is not enough — the Second Circuit affirmed Soroban (limited ' +
      'partners must be passive investors), and the Fifth Circuit in Sirius ' +
      'Solutions withdrew its January 2026 opinion and held in August 2026 ' +
      'that a limited partner is one who plays no significant role in ' +
      'managing or running the business. Denham Capital is pending in the ' +
      'First Circuit. Plan on SE tax for any owner who works in the business.',
      'California entity taxes change the comparison: an S corporation pays ' +
      '1.5% of net income ($800 minimum); an LLC taxed as a partnership pays ' +
      '$800 plus a fee on total California gross receipts ($900 at $250,000, ' +
      '$2,500 at $500,000, $6,000 at $1 million, $11,790 at $5 million) — a ' +
      'fee on receipts, owed even in a loss year; a limited partnership or ' +
      'LLP pays $800 only; a general partnership pays nothing. On a ' +
      'low-margin, high-revenue business the LLC fee can exceed the 1.5% ' +
      'tax; on a high-margin business the 1.5% is the larger cost. Both ' +
      'forms can elect the 9.3% pass-through entity tax.',
      'Allocations: partnerships can specially allocate income, loss, and ' +
      'cash flow disproportionately to ownership if the allocations have ' +
      'substantial economic effect (§704(b); Reg. §1.704-1(b)). S corps are ' +
      'locked to strict pro-rata, single-class-of-stock sharing (§1361(b)(1)(D), ' +
      '§1366) — no waterfall, no preferred return, no carried interest.',
      'Debt basis: partnership liabilities are allocated to partners\' outside ' +
      'basis under §752, supporting loss deductions and tax-free debt-financed ' +
      'distributions. S-corp shareholders get basis only from stock and DIRECT ' +
      'loans they make to the corporation (§1366(d)(1)(B)) — entity-level bank ' +
      'debt gives them nothing. Decisive for leveraged real estate.',
      'Basis step-ups: with a §754 election, a partnership adjusts inside ' +
      'basis under §743(b) on a sale or death of a partner (and §734(b) on ' +
      'distributions) — the buyer/heir effectively gets fresh depreciation. ' +
      'S corps have no inside-basis step-up mechanism; the step-up strands at ' +
      'the stock level.',
      'Guaranteed payments are the partnership\'s comp flexibility: fixed ' +
      'amounts for services or capital, deductible by the partnership, set by ' +
      'agreement — no "reasonableness" exam standard, but SE-taxed in full and ' +
      'excluded from the recipient\'s QBI (Reg. §1.199A-3(b)(2)(ii)(I)).',
      'Property in, property out: appreciated property generally enters (§721) ' +
      'and exits (§731) a partnership tax-free; an S corp recognizes gain on ' +
      'distributing appreciated property (§311(b)) — partnerships age better ' +
      'for appreciating assets.'

      'Leaving California out of the comparison: 1.5% of S-corp income versus an LLC fee of up to $11,790 on gross receipts can swing the answer by thousands a year in either direction.',
      'Choosing S for the payroll savings and later discovering the deal needs preferred returns, waterfalls, or new investor classes the single-class-of-stock rule forbids — a common and expensive regret.',
      'Terminating S status inadvertently (a second class of stock via side agreements, an ineligible shareholder) blows the election.',
      'Partnership complexity is real: §704(c) allocations, capital-account maintenance, and liability recomputations raise prep cost and error risk.',

    plainEnglish: [
      'When a business has more than one owner, there are two main ways to set it up for taxes: a partnership or an S corporation. They look similar from the outside — both pass profits to the owners\' returns — but they behave very differently, and picking the wrong one can cost you every year.',
      'The S corporation usually saves on payroll-style taxes: you take a fair salary, and profits above it avoid the extra 15%. But it comes with rigid rules — every owner must share profits exactly in proportion to ownership, no exceptions. A partnership flips that: owners can split profits, losses, and cash in almost any way they agree to, one owner can be paid a fixed amount for their work, and loans the business takes out can unlock deductions for the owners.',
      'Neither is "better" — it depends on whether your business is mostly about the owners\' work (S corporation often wins) or about property, debt, and flexible deals between owners (partnership often wins). We run your actual numbers both ways before anything gets filed.'
    ],
    analogy: 'It\'s like choosing between a sedan and a pickup: the sedan is cheaper to run every day, but if your life involves hauling things, the truck pays for itself. The mistake is buying on sticker price without looking at your driveway.',
    benefits: [
      'A structure matched to how your business actually makes money',
      'Payroll-tax savings when the S corporation route fits',
      'Freedom to split profits unevenly and reward sweat equity when the partnership route fits',
      'Fewer expensive do-overs when investors, property, or heirs enter the picture'

    steps: [
      'We map how your business earns, borrows, and pays its owners',

      'We revisit the choice whenever owners, debt, or plans change'
    ],
    considerations: [
      'The flexible partnership route means active owners pay self-employment tax on their full share of profits — flexibility has a price, and we quantify it.',
      'California taxes the two differently: an S corporation pays 1.5% of its profit, while an LLC pays $800 plus a fee based on its total sales, even in a year with no profit. We include both in the side-by-side numbers.',
      'The S corporation\'s rules are strict: equal sharing, limited types of owners. If your plans include investors or uneven splits, it can box you in.',
      'Switching structures later is possible but can trigger tax, so we aim to get it right before the business appreciates.'
