    summary:
      'For taxpayers above the §199A taxable-income threshold ($403,500 MFJ / ' +
      '$201,750 single, 2026), the QBI deduction is capped at the greater of ' +
      '50% of the business\'s W-2 wages or 25% of W-2 wages plus 2.5% of UBIA ' +
      'of qualified property (§199A(b)(2)(B)). When the deduction is ' +
      'wage-limited, raising owner salary is counterintuitively accretive: each ' +
      'added wage dollar shrinks QBI by ~$1.08 (wage + employer FICA) but ' +
      'raises the wage cap by $0.50, and the net deduction can INCREASE until ' +
      'the two prongs cross. The optimum sits where the marginal QBI benefit ' +
      'equals the marginal payroll-tax cost — roughly the classic 2/7 ' +
      '(≈28.6%) of profit BEFORE owner wages, which is the same as wages equal ' +
      'to 40% of QBI, before payroll-tax drag. This is inseparable ' +
      'from the S-corp reasonable-compensation analysis: the same salary number ' +
      'drives payroll tax, reasonable-comp exposure, and the wage limit.',
    mechanics: [
      'Above the threshold plus the OBBBA-widened phase-in range ($75k single / ' +
      '$150k MFJ starting 2026), the deduction for a non-SSTB is ' +
      'min(20% × QBI, greater of 50% × W-2 wages or 25% × W-2 wages + 2.5% × UBIA).',
      'With only the 50%-of-wages prong, the crossover is where 20% × (profit − ' +
      '1.0765 × wages) = 50% × wages — wages ≈ 27.5–28.6% of pre-wage profit. ' +
      'Below that ratio, added salary grows the total deduction despite reducing QBI.',
      'The wage dollar is not free: employer FICA (6.2% Social Security up to the ' +
      '$184,500 base + 1.45% Medicare) plus the employee half charged on the W-2. ' +
      'The optimum is where marginal QBI-deduction benefit × marginal rate = ' +
      'marginal payroll-tax cost — run the model, not the heuristic.',
      'W-2 wages counted are those properly allocable to QBI and reported on ' +
      'Forms W-2/941 (Rev. Proc. 2019-11 gives three computation methods). Wages ' +
      'to non-owner employees count too — accelerating a planned hire or bonus ' +
      'into the tax year raises the cap without owner payroll-tax exposure to ' +
      'the additional Medicare tax stacking on owner wages.',
      'Guaranteed payments to partners are NOT W-2 wages and do not support the ' +
      'limit (§199A(b)(4); Reg. §1.199A-2) — this lever belongs to S corporations ' +
      'and entities with genuine employees, not to partnerships paying partners.',
      'Capital-heavy businesses with low payroll (e.g., real estate) usually do ' +
      'better under the 25% + 2.5% UBIA prong. THIS ENGINE MODELS ONLY THE 50% ' +
      'WAGE PRONG — where UBIA is material, compute the alternative prong ' +
      'off-model before recommending added salary.'
