    summary:
      'Under §280A(g), a taxpayer who rents their personal residence for fewer ' +
      'than 15 days per year excludes the rental income entirely — no ' +
      'tax (the business still issues a 1099-MISC once the rent reaches $2,000). The business entity rents the owner\'s home for legitimate business ' +
      'meetings (board meetings, planning retreats, trainings) at a documented ' +
      'market rate and deducts the rent under §162. Result: deductible to the ' +
      'entity, tax-free to the owner. Sinopoli (2023) shows the IRS will attack ' +
      'inflated rates and thin documentation, not the structure itself.',
    mechanics: [
      '§280A(g): if a dwelling used as a residence is rented for < 15 days ' +
      'during the year, rental income is excluded and rental deductions denied.',
      'The entity deducts rent as an ordinary and necessary expense under §162 — ' +
      'which requires a bona fide business purpose for each rental day.',
      'Market rate must be defensible: comparable local venue quotes (hotel ' +
      'conference rooms, event spaces) for similar capacity/duration, retained ' +
      'in the file. Daily-rate comps, not monthly residential rent ÷ 30.',
      'Each meeting needs contemporaneous support: agenda, minutes, attendees, ' +
      'invoice from the owner to the entity, and actual payment.',
      'Works with S corps, partnerships, and C corps. A Schedule C sole ' +
      'proprietor renting from themselves is one taxpayer paying itself — the ' +
      'deduction is not respected (§280A(a) disallowance applies with no ' +
      'separate-entity payor). Requires a separate entity.'

      'Exceeding 14 days converts every dollar to taxable rental income.',

      'Calendar the meetings; prepare agenda + minutes each time.',
