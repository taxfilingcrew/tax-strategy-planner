    summary:
      'Fills the gap between elective deferrals and the §415(c) annual additions ' +
      'ceiling — the LESSER of $72,000 (2026) or 100% of the participant\'s ' +
      'compensation — with non-Roth after-tax employee ' +
      'contributions, then immediately converts them via in-plan Roth rollover ' +
      '(§402A(c)(4)) or rollover to a Roth IRA. After a maxed $24,500 deferral ' +
      'and typical employer contributions, this can move $30,000–$45,000+ per ' +
      'year into Roth status. There is NO current deduction — after-tax means ' +
      'after-tax — so this strategy appears in the plan as advisory: its value is ' +
      'decades of tax-free growth, not a line on this year\'s return. Unlike the ' +
      'IRA backdoor, the §408(d)(2) pro-rata trap does not apply: plan ' +
      'accounting tracks the after-tax subaccount separately, and Notice 2014-54 ' +
      'lets basis and earnings be split cleanly on distribution.',
    mechanics: [
      'Capacity = §415(c) ceiling − elective deferrals − employer ' +
      'contributions, where the ceiling is the lesser of $72,000 (2026) or ' +
      '100% of compensation (W-2 wages from the business, or earned income ' +
      'for the self-employed — K-1 profit of an S corporation does not ' +
      'count). Example at $150,000 of pay: $24,500 deferral + $12,500 ' +
      'employer leaves $35,000 of after-tax capacity. At $50,000 of S-corp ' +
      'salary the ceiling is $50,000, so a $24,500 deferral and a $12,500 ' +
      'employer contribution leave only $13,000 — and the after-tax ' +
      'contribution has to come out of that same paycheck.',
      'The plan document must permit BOTH non-Roth after-tax employee ' +
      'contributions AND in-plan Roth conversions (or in-service distribution of ' +
      'the after-tax account). Most off-the-shelf plans allow neither — check ' +
      'first, amend if needed.',
      'Convert immediately: earnings accrued between contribution and conversion ' +
      'are taxable at conversion, so a same-payroll sweep (many providers ' +
      'automate this) keeps the taxable slice near zero.',
      'In plans with staff, after-tax contributions are ACP-tested under ' +
      '§401(m) — heavy owner use in a small plan with low staff participation ' +
      'fails testing and gets refunded. Owner-only solo 401(k)s have no ACP ' +
      'test, making them the cleanest chassis.',
      'Contrast with the IRA backdoor: no aggregation with the client\'s ' +
      'pre-tax IRAs — the plan\'s separate accounting replaces the §408(d)(2) ' +
      'pro-rata fraction.'

    plainEnglish: [
      'A Roth account is the best deal in retirement savings: the money grows for decades and you never pay tax on it again — not on the growth, not when you take it out. The catch is the front door is tiny: normal Roth contributions are capped at a few thousand dollars a year, and high earners are locked out entirely.',
      'But inside a 401(k) there is a bigger door most people never notice. The law allows total yearly contributions of up to $72,000 (or your pay from the business, if that is less) — far beyond the usual limits — if your plan is set up to accept a special extra type of contribution. Once those dollars are in, we convert them to Roth right away, where they grow tax-free for good.',
      'These extra contributions do not reduce this year\'s tax bill — you fund them with money you have already paid tax on. The payoff comes later, and it compounds: decades of growth the IRS never touches, and no required withdrawals forcing money out on the government\'s schedule.'
