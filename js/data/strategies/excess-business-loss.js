    summary:
      '§461(l) — made permanent by OBBBA — caps the aggregate business loss a ' +
      'noncorporate taxpayer can deduct against nonbusiness income in one year: ' +
      '$256,000 single / $512,000 MFJ for 2026 (OBBBA reset the inflation base, which is why the figure is lower than 2025; Rev. Proc. 2025-32). ' +
      'The disallowed excess business loss ' +
      'becomes an NOL carryover to the following year (§461(l)(2)) — so the ' +
      'limitation is a one-year timing toll, but the carryover then inherits the ' +
      '§172 80% cap and loses the ability to offset the CURRENT year\'s wages ' +
      'and portfolio income. Critically, W-2 wages are NOT business income for ' +
      'this computation (CARES Act clarification), so a high-wage spouse plus a ' +
      'big loss business is the classic trapped-loss fact pattern. Planning ' +
      'levers: manage the wage/business income mix, aggregate business income ' +
      'and gains correctly, and time discretionary deductions and income so ' +
      'losses land where they are usable. The engine does not enforce §461(l) ' +
      '(a documented v1 simplification) — this entry exists so large modeled ' +
      'losses are sanity-checked against the cap.',
    mechanics: [
      'Compute aggregate business deductions minus aggregate business income ' +
      'and gains across ALL trades or businesses; the excess over the threshold ' +
      '($256k/$512k for 2026, indexed under §461(l)(3)(C)) is disallowed for ' +
      'the year and reported on Form 461.',
      'Employee wages are NOT attributable to a trade or business for this ' +
      'computation (§461(l)(3), as clarified by the CARES Act) — a $700k-wage ' +
      'household cannot use wages as "business income" to absorb a $900k loss.',
      'Business capital gains count toward business income only to a limited ' +
      'extent (gains from the trade or business, e.g., §1231 gains); portfolio ' +
      'gains do not help.',
      'The disallowed EBL converts to an NOL carryover next year (§461(l)(2)) ' +
      '— then subject to the §172 80% limitation. The cost is deferral plus the ' +
      'possible rate differential, not permanent disallowance.',
      'California: the state has its own excess business loss limit, computed ' +
      'on FTB 3461, and it works differently — the disallowed amount is NOT ' +
      'turned into an NOL; it is carried forward as an excess business loss ' +
      'and re-tested against the limit in the following year. California did ' +
      'not adopt the federal suspension for 2018–2020, its threshold for the ' +
      'year can differ from the federal figure, and its NOL deduction is ' +
      'separately suspended for 2024–2026 for taxpayers with $1 million or ' +
      'more of income. Keep a separate California carryforward schedule.',
      'Ordering: §461(l) applies AFTER basis, at-risk (§465), and passive ' +
      'activity (§469) limits — a loss must clear all three gates before the ' +
      'EBL cap even matters.',
      'Levers: shift owner compensation between W-2 wages and pass-through ' +
      'income where legitimate (S-corp reasonable comp still required); time ' +
      'elective deductions (bonus depreciation elections, §179) so they do not ' +
      'create a trapped loss; accelerate income into the loss year to absorb ' +
      'the loss currently rather than carry it.'

      'California carries the disallowed loss forward under its own rule (still an excess business loss, re-limited each year) — using the federal NOL figure on the state return is an error.',
      'Misclassifying wages or portfolio gains as business income to absorb losses is a computational error the IRS catches on Form 461 matching.',
      'Recharacterizing owner comp purely to manage §461(l) collides with S-corp reasonable-compensation requirements.',

    teaser: 'Keeps a big write-off year from getting stuck behind an IRS ceiling',
    headline: 'Plan around the ceiling on business losses',
    plainEnglish: [
      'When a business has a very large loss year — often on purpose, from big equipment or property write-offs — there\'s a ceiling on how much of that loss can offset your other income, like wages and investments, in a single year. For 2026 the ceiling is $256,000 for singles and $512,000 for married couples — notably LOWER than 2025, because the 2025 tax law reset the starting point.',
      'Losses above the ceiling aren\'t gone — they roll into future years — but rolling forward is slower and usually less valuable than using them now. And one common surprise: a spouse\'s salary doesn\'t count as business income here, so high-salary households hit this ceiling more easily than they expect.',
      'The fix is planning the size and timing of the loss. We can dial big write-offs up or down between years, or bring more business income into the loss year, so your losses do their work now instead of waiting in line.'
    ],
    analogy: 'It\'s like a drain that can only handle so much water per hour — pour faster and the rest pools and waits. We pour at the rate the drain can take, so nothing sits around losing value.',
    benefits: [
      'Big write-off years planned so the deductions actually land now',
      'No surprise at filing time when a loss gets partially benched',
      'Leftover losses tracked and pointed at your best future years',
      'Write-off elections sized year by year to stay under the ceiling'
    ],
    steps: [
      'Before any big write-off year, we project the total loss against the ceiling',
      'We size and time the write-offs — or shift income — so the loss is fully usable',
      'We file the required IRS form and track anything that carries forward',
      'We re-check every year as the ceiling adjusts for inflation'
    ],
    considerations: [
      'Losses over the ceiling are delayed, not lost — but a delayed deduction is worth less than one you use today, which is exactly why we plan around it.',
      'The comparison numbers in this tool don\'t apply the ceiling automatically — where it matters for you, we adjust the projections by hand and tell you.'
