      'A one-participant 401(k) for an owner (and spouse) with no common-law ' +
      'employees. The owner contributes in two capacities: elective deferrals up ' +
      'to $24,500 (2026, §402(g); +$8,000 catch-up at 50+, $11,250 at 60–63 under ' +
      'SECURE 2.0), plus an employer contribution of up to 25% of W-2 compensation ' +
      '(S corp) or ~20% of net self-employment earnings (Schedule C). Combined ' +
      'annual additions are capped at $72,000 under §415(c) — catch-up rides on ' +
      'top. For self-employed owners the deduction is above-the-line and also ' +
      'reduces §199A QBI; for S corp owners the deferral reduces Box 1 wages and ' +
      'the employer piece is an entity deduction. Beats a SEP at the same income ' +
      'because the deferral layer does not depend on the 25%/20% math.',

      '(SECURE 2.0 enhanced catch-up). If prior-year FICA wages exceeded $150,000, ' +
      'catch-up must be designated Roth (SECURE 2.0 §603).',
      'Employer profit-sharing: 25% of W-2 wages for an S corp owner-employee; for ' +
      'a sole proprietor, effectively ~20% of net SE earnings (the 25% limit applied ' +
      'to earnings net of the contribution itself and half of SE tax).',
      'Total annual additions (deferral + employer, excluding catch-up) capped at ' +
      '$72,000 under §415(c); compensation counted up to $360,000 (§401(a)(17)).',
      'Deferrals do NOT reduce FICA/SE tax — the income tax deduction is the whole ' +
