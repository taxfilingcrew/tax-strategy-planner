    summary:
      '§168(k) allows a 100% first-year deduction for qualified property — ' +
      'MACRS property with a recovery period of 20 years or less, including ' +
      'equipment, furniture, land improvements, and QIP — made permanent by ' +
      'OBBBA (P.L. 119-21) for property acquired and placed in service after ' +
      '1/19/2025. Bonus is automatic unless the taxpayer elects out; the real ' +
      'planning work is the annual election-out analysis under §168(k)(7), by ' +
      'class of property, for years where an immediate deduction would be ' +
      'wasted — losses trapped by §469 or §461(l), NOL positions, low-bracket ' +
      'years, or QBI taxable-income games. Acceleration is a timing benefit: ' +
      'depreciation taken now is unavailable later.',
    mechanics: [
      'Qualified property under §168(k)(2): MACRS recovery period ≤ 20 years ' +
      '(5/7/15-year personalty and land improvements, 15-year QIP), certain ' +
      'computer software, and used property acquired by purchase from an ' +
      'unrelated party (post-TCJA).',
      '100% of eligible basis is deducted in the placed-in-service year; the ' +
      'asset\'s remaining basis is zero, so no depreciation remains for later years.',
      'The deduction lands where the asset lives: Schedule C/F, the entity ' +
      'return (flowing through the K-1), or Schedule E for rental assets — ' +
      'which determines whether it also saves SE tax and how §469 applies.',
      'Election OUT under §168(k)(7) is made annually, by class (all 5-year ' +
      'property, all 7-year property, etc.), on a timely filed return ' +
      'including extensions — generally irrevocable without IRS consent.',
      'Elect out when the deduction would be wasted or wasteful: a §469-' +
      'suspended rental loss, a §461(l)-limited business loss, an NOL year, a ' +
      'temporarily low bracket, or where spreading depreciation preserves ' +
      'taxable income needed for §199A QBI or the §179(b)(3) limit.',
      'Bonus vs. §179: bonus is all-or-nothing by class with no dollar cap or ' +
      'income limit; §179 is asset-by-asset but capped and limited to business ' +
      'income. Many plans use both deliberately.'
