    summary:
      'A Health Reimbursement Arrangement is an employer-funded plan that ' +
      'reimburses employees for medical care: the corporation deducts the ' +
      'reimbursements under §162, and the employee excludes them under §105(b) ' +
      'and §106(a) — no income tax, no FICA. The C-corp is the uniquely clean ' +
      'chassis: a C-corp owner-employee is simply an employee and participates ' +
      'tax-free, whereas a >2% S-corp shareholder is treated as a partner under ' +
      '§1372 and cannot exclude the benefit (their premiums land on the W-2 and ' +
      'route through §162(l) instead). The compliance gate is the ACA market ' +
      'reforms (Notice 2013-54): a standalone HRA covering two or more ' +
      'employees generally must be integrated with group coverage or fit a ' +
      'sanctioned design (QSEHRA, ICHRA, excepted-benefit HRA) — the exposure ' +
      'for getting this wrong is the §4980D excise tax of $100 per employee ' +
      'per day. Advisory-only: the dollar benefit depends on entity structure ' +
      'and actual medical spend, so it is quantified in the entity design, not ' +
      'modeled from return inputs here.',
    mechanics: [
      'Corporation adopts a written §105 plan; reimbursements of §213(d) ' +
      'medical expenses (and, if designed in, individual premiums where the ' +
      'HRA type permits) are deductible to the corporation and excluded from ' +
      'the employee\'s income and FICA wages.',
      'C-corp owner-employees participate on the same footing as any employee ' +
      '— the double-tax structure that usually penalizes C-corps works FOR the ' +
      'owner here: family medical costs become corporate deductions with no ' +
      'shareholder-level income.',
      'Contrast: >2% S-corp shareholders (and their spouses/dependents via ' +
      'attribution) are barred from tax-free participation by §1372; partners ' +
      'are barred as self-employed persons. This strategy is a reason clients ' +
      'with heavy family medical costs sometimes keep or create a C-corp.',
      'ACA market reforms (PHSA §2711 annual-limit ban and §2713 preventive ' +
      'mandate, imported into the Code): a standalone HRA covering 2+ ' +
      'employees violates them unless integrated with a group health plan or ' +
      'structured as a QSEHRA, ICHRA, or excepted-benefit HRA. A plan with ' +
      'fewer than two PARTICIPANTS who are current employees is exempt ' +
      '(§9831(a)(2)) — the test counts participants, not the size of the ' +
      'workforce, and two family members who each participate as employees ' +
      'are two participants.',
      'PCORI fee: an HRA is a self-insured health plan, so the sponsor owes ' +
      'the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research fee — a few dollars per covered ' +
      'life per year, indexed — reported on Form 720 by July 31 following the ' +
      'plan year. An HRA paired with an INSURED medical plan still owes its ' +
      'own fee (counting one life per participant); one paired with the ' +
      'employer\'s self-insured plan with the same plan year is counted once. ' +
      'Small, but a missed annual filing.',
      'Self-insured plan nondiscrimination under §105(h): if the HRA favors ' +
      'highly compensated individuals as to eligibility or benefits, the HCI\'s ' +
      'excess reimbursements become taxable — cover a nondiscriminatory class ' +
      'or accept taxation of the discriminatory excess.'

    plainEnglish: [
      'If your business is set up as a regular corporation, there is a benefit available to you that most business owners never use: the corporation can adopt a formal plan to reimburse its employees for medical costs — doctor visits, prescriptions, dental, vision, deductibles. Those reimbursements are a deductible business expense for the company, and the employee pays no tax on them.',
      'Here is the part that matters: as the owner working in your own corporation, YOU are one of those employees. Medical bills your family was going to pay anyway, with money that had already been taxed, can instead be paid by the company with money that never gets taxed at all.',
      'The rules about how the plan is set up matter a great deal — health-care law limits how these plans can be designed, and the penalties for a sloppy plan are severe. Done properly, with the right paperwork in place first, it is a clean and well-established benefit.'

      'This works cleanly for regular corporations — if your business is an S-corporation, the rules treat owners differently and we would use other strategies instead.',
      'The plan must be in writing, in place first, and every reimbursement backed by a receipt — the penalties for informal arrangements are large, so we do not cut corners.',
