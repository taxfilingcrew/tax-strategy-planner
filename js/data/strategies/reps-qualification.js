    summary:
      '§469(c)(2) makes rental activities per-se passive, trapping losses ' +
      'against passive income only. §469(c)(7) removes the per-se taint for a ' +
      'taxpayer who (1) performs more than 750 hours AND (2) more than half ' +
      'of all personal-service time in real property trades or businesses in ' +
      'which they materially participate. The rentals still must clear ' +
      'material participation individually — or as one activity via the Reg. ' +
      '§1.469-9(g) aggregation election. REPS is the master key that lets ' +
      'cost segregation, bonus depreciation, and ordinary rental losses ' +
      'offset W-2 and business income currently. On a joint return only one ' +
      'spouse must qualify, but that spouse must meet both hour tests alone.',
    mechanics: [
      'Two-part test under §469(c)(7)(B), applied to ONE spouse individually: ' +
      '>750 hours in real property trades or businesses (development, ' +
      'construction, acquisition, rental, management, brokerage, etc.) AND ' +
      'more than 50% of ALL personal services performed that year — a ' +
      'full-time W-2 job outside real estate makes the 50% prong nearly ' +
      'impossible.',
      'Qualifying removes the per-se passive label, but each rental must ' +
      'still pass a Reg. §1.469-5T(a) material participation test (500 hours; ' +
      'substantially all participation; >100 hours and more than anyone else; ' +
      'etc.) — per property, unless aggregated.',
      'The Reg. §1.469-9(g) election treats ALL rental real estate interests ' +
      'as a single activity, so material participation is tested once across ' +
      'the whole portfolio. Filed as a statement with the return; binding on ' +
      'future years until revoked for a material change in circumstances.',
      'Employee hours count only if the taxpayer owns >5% of the employer ' +
      '(§469(c)(7)(D)(ii)) — a salaried property manager with no ownership ' +
      'gets zero qualifying hours.',
      'Documentation is the battleground: contemporaneous time logs, ' +
      'calendars, and records win or lose these cases. Courts reject ' +
      '"ballpark guesstimates" reconstructed at exam.'

      'REPS is tested EVERY year; a qualifying 2026 does not carry into 2027.',

    implementation: [

      'Start a contemporaneous time log now (app or calendar-based); record dates, hours, and tasks.',
      'Evaluate and, if appropriate, file the Reg. §1.469-9(g) aggregation election statement with the timely return.',
      'Confirm material participation under a specific §1.469-5T(a) test and document which one.',

If you spend more than 750 hours a year — and more than half of your total working time — on real estate activities, and you are hands-on with your rentals, the lock comes off. Your rental losses can then offset wages, business income, everything.',
