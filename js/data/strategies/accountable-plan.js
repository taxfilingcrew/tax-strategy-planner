    summary:
      'A written reimbursement arrangement meeting Reg. §1.62-2\'s three tests ' +
      '(business connection, substantiation, return of excess). Reimbursements ' +
      'are deductible to the entity and excluded from the owner-employee\'s W-2 ' +
      'income — no income tax, no FICA. Critical for S-corp owners: unreimbursed ' +
      'employee expenses are nondeductible (the 2%-misc itemized deduction is ' +
      'permanently gone post-TCJA/OBBBA), so expenses the owner eats personally ' +
      'produce zero tax benefit. The accountable plan is the only clean path for ' +
      'home office, personal-vehicle, and mixed-use expenses of an S-corp owner.',
    mechanics: [
      'Three requirements (Reg. §1.62-2(d)-(f)): (1) business connection — the ' +
      'expense is deductible under §162 and incurred in service to the employer; ' +
      '(2) substantiation within a reasonable period (60 days is the safe harbor); ' +
      '(3) return of any excess advance within a reasonable period (120 days).',
      'Reimbursements are excluded from wages (§62(a)(2)(A), §62(c)) — they never ' +
      'hit the W-2, avoiding both income tax and both halves of FICA.',
      'Home office: reimburse the business-use percentage of rent/mortgage ' +
      'interest, utilities, insurance, repairs — computed like Form 8829 but paid ' +
      'as a reimbursement. No depreciation recapture issue since the entity ' +
      '(not the owner) takes the deduction as an expense.',
      'Vehicle: standard mileage rate × substantiated business miles (mileage ' +
      'log required under §274(d)), or actual-expense business percentage.',
      'Failure of any test makes the arrangement nonaccountable: everything paid ' +
      'becomes W-2 wages subject to withholding and FICA (Reg. §1.62-2(c)(5)).'

    requirements: [
      'A written plan adopted by the entity (board resolution / consent).',
      'Owner-employee status (works for any employee, but the win is for S-corp owners).',
      'Expense reports with receipts within the safe-harbor windows (60/120 days).',
      'Actual reimbursement payments from the entity account — not journal entries at year-end (sloppy but common; contemporaneous is defensible).'
    ],
    risks: [
      'Blown substantiation converts reimbursements to W-2 wages retroactively — payroll tax, withholding, penalties.',
      'Year-end lump-sum "reimbursements" with no expense reports look like disguised wages (Rev. Rul. 2012-25).',
      'Mileage without a contemporaneous log fails §274(d) — the most commonly lost deduction in exam.',
      'Home-office percentage must reflect exclusive, regular business use.'

    implementation: [
      'Adopt a written accountable plan (template resolution + plan document).',
      'Build the home-office worksheet (square footage %, eligible costs).',
      'Set a monthly or quarterly expense-report cadence with receipt capture.',

    plainEnglish: [
      'You already spend personal money on your business: a home office, your car, your cell phone, internet, supplies. Without a formal plan, those dollars come out of your pocket with no tax benefit at all — the tax law no longer lets employees deduct them.',
      'An accountable plan is a simple written policy that lets your business pay you back for those costs. The reimbursement is a deductible expense for the business, and it is completely tax-free money to you — no income tax, no payroll tax.',
      'You were already spending this money. The plan just makes sure it comes back to you tax-free instead of disappearing.'

    analogy: 'It works exactly like the expense reports at any large company — you submit the expense, the company pays you back, and nobody pays tax on a reimbursement. Your business just needs the policy in place.',

      'Your business deducts every dollar it pays you back',
