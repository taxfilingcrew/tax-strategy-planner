    summary:
      'An aircraft used predominantly in a trade or business can generate very ' +
      'large deductions: operating costs under §162 and depreciation — ' +
      'including 100% bonus under §168(k) (permanent post-OBBBA) — on the ' +
      'purchase. But aircraft are the single most audit-exposed deduction in ' +
      'this library: they are §280F listed property requiring >50% qualified ' +
      'business use with flight-by-flight substantiation, entertainment flights ' +
      'are disallowed under the Reg. §1.274-10 occupied-seat rules, personal ' +
      'flights by owners must be imputed as income under the SIFL rules, and ' +
      'the IRS announced a dedicated corporate/high-income aircraft audit ' +
      'campaign in February 2024. The advisor enters the annual deduction from ' +
      'a separate depreciation and cost analysis; this tool models the tax ' +
      'effect only. Do not present this strategy without the underlying study.',
    mechanics: [
      'Deductibility starts with §162: the flying must be ordinary and ' +
      'necessary to the business (client visits, multi-site operations, ' +
      'time-critical travel a commercial schedule cannot serve), documented ' +
      'flight-by-flight with passengers and business purpose.',
      'Aircraft are listed property (§280F(d)(4) — property used as a means of ' +
      'transportation): accelerated depreciation and bonus require MORE than ' +
      '50% qualified business use each year, tested with detailed flight logs; ' +
      'falling below triggers recapture and ADS straight-line going forward.',
      'Entertainment use is disallowed: Reg. §1.274-10 requires allocating ' +
      'costs (including depreciation) across flights by occupied seat hours/' +
      'miles and disallows the share attributable to entertainment passengers, ' +
      'even when income is imputed to the executive.',
      'Personal non-entertainment flights by an owner-employee are compensation: ' +
      'income is imputed under the SIFL formula of Reg. §1.61-21(g) (or actual ' +
      'charter value), and the deduction/compensation mismatch is a recurring ' +
      'exam adjustment.',
      'If the activity is not conducted for profit (the "N-number hobby"), §183 ' +
      'limits deductions; leasing structures between the owner and the business ' +
      'also raise §469 passive/self-rental and sales-tax issues that need ' +
      'separate analysis.',
      'The IRS Large Business & International division announced an aircraft-' +
      'usage audit campaign in February 2024 targeting exactly this fact ' +
      'pattern — assume this deduction will be examined and build the file first.'

      'If your business genuinely depends on private air travel — multiple locations, clients spread across the map, schedules commercial airlines cannot meet — the tax law allows real deductions: the operating costs of business flights, and potentially a very large first-year depreciation write-off on the aircraft itself.',
      'This is also one of the most closely watched deductions in the entire tax code. The IRS runs a dedicated audit program for business aircraft. Every flight needs a log showing who was on board and why. Personal trips get added to your income at IRS-set rates, and vacation-style flights can cancel part of the deduction. None of that is a reason to avoid the strategy — it is a reason to do it properly.',
