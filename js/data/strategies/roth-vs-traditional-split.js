    summary:
      'Every deferral dollar (up to $24,500 for 2026) can be designated ' +
      'traditional (deduct now, taxed later) or Roth (taxed now, never again) — ' +
      'and the split is an annual election, not a one-time identity. The core ' +
      'analysis is marginal rate now vs. expected effective rate in withdrawal ' +
      'years. OBBBA\'s permanence of the TCJA rate structure removed the ' +
      '"rates snap back in 2026" argument that had favored Roth by default; the ' +
      'calculus is now client-specific: current bracket, retirement income ' +
      'floor (RMDs, Social Security), state-of-residence arbitrage, and estate ' +
      'intentions. One piece is no longer elective for some: under SECURE 2.0 ' +
      '§603, a participant whose prior-year FICA wages FROM THE EMPLOYER ' +
      'SPONSORING THE PLAN exceeded $150,000 (2026 threshold) must make ' +
      'catch-up contributions as Roth. It is not a rule for all high ' +
      'earners: a self-employed owner has no FICA wages and is exempt, and ' +
      'so is an S-corp owner whose W-2 from the corporation was $150,000 or ' +
      'less, whatever the K-1 shows.',
    mechanics: [
      'Same $24,500 limit either way (§402(g)) — but Roth dollars are worth ' +
      'more at equal balances, since the tax is already paid; a maxed Roth ' +
      'account effectively shelters more real wealth.',
      'Traditional wins when the contribution-year marginal rate clearly ' +
      'exceeds the expected withdrawal-year rate — the classic case: peak-' +
      'earnings 35–37% bracket now, moderate retirement income later.',
      'Roth wins in temporarily low-income years (startup year, loss year, ' +
      'sabbatical, early retirement pre-RMD), for young high-trajectory savers, ' +
      'and where large pre-tax balances already guarantee heavy RMDs at 73+.',
      'OBBBA (P.L. 119-21) made the TCJA individual rate structure permanent — ' +
      'no scheduled rate sunset. Rate risk is now legislative, not calendared, ' +
      'which weakens the reflexive "rates are going up" Roth pitch and makes ' +
      'the client\'s own income trajectory the dominant variable.',
      'Mandatory Roth catch-up (SECURE 2.0 §603; §414(v)(7)): prior-year FICA ' +
      'wages over $150,000 (2026, indexed) from the plan\'s sponsor force the ' +
      '$8,000/$11,250 catch-up into Roth — affected clients lose that ' +
      'deduction whether they like it or not, and if the plan has no Roth ' +
      'feature they cannot make catch-up contributions at all. WHO IS ' +
      'OUTSIDE THE RULE: sole proprietors and partners (self-employment ' +
      'income is not FICA wages); S-corp owners paid $150,000 or less in W-2 ' +
      'wages; and SEP and SIMPLE IRA participants. Wages from a different, ' +
      'unrelated employer do not count toward the test.',
      'Roth 401(k) accounts no longer have lifetime RMDs (SECURE 2.0 aligned ' +
      'them with Roth IRAs beginning 2024) — strengthening Roth as an estate ' +
      'and longevity asset; heirs still take under the 10-year rule but ' +
      'distributions are tax-free.'

    plainEnglish: [
      'Your retirement contributions come with a choice the paperwork makes look boring but that is worth real money: pay tax on this money now, or pay tax on it later. The "traditional" option gives you a deduction today, and the IRS taxes every dollar when you retire. The "Roth" option skips today\'s deduction, and in exchange the money — and all its growth — is never taxed again.',
      'Neither is always right. The answer depends on comparing your tax rate today with your likely rate in retirement — and that changes with your income, your other savings, even which state you plan to retire in. In a big-income year, the deduction is king. In a lighter year, paying a low rate now to lock in tax-free growth forever is the bargain.',
      'The good news: you do not have to pick a side for life. We can split your contributions between the two buckets and adjust the mix every year as your situation moves. One heads-up for higher earners over 50: a recent law change requires part of your contribution to go in the Roth bucket whether you choose it or not — we plan around that.'
