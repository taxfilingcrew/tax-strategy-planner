    summary:
      'Rev. Proc. 2013-30 provides a streamlined, no-user-fee path to ' +
      'retroactive S corporation status when Form 2553 was filed late (or ' +
      'never filed) — generally available up to 3 years and 75 days after the ' +
      'intended effective date. The corporation must show it intended S status ' +
      'as of that date, failed to qualify solely because the election was not ' +
      'timely filed, has reasonable cause, and that the entity and all ' +
      'shareholders reported consistently with S status for every affected ' +
      'year. Relief is claimed by filing Form 2553 with the required ' +
      'statements — either attached to Form 1120-S or filed separately — with ' +
      '"FILED PURSUANT TO REV. PROC. 2013-30" across the top. This strategy ' +
      'rescues the client who has been operating "as an S corp" without a ' +
      'valid election; the S-Corp Election strategy in this library models ' +
      'the dollar benefit.',
    mechanics: [
      'Normal deadline: §1362(b) requires Form 2553 by the 15th day of the ' +
      '3rd month of the year the election is to take effect (2 months + 15 ' +
      'days in). Miss it and the election defaults to the following year — ' +
      'unless relief applies.',
      'Statutory hook: §1362(b)(5) authorizes the IRS to treat a late ' +
      'election as timely where reasonable cause is shown; Rev. Proc. 2013-30 ' +
      'is the streamlined administrative implementation (consolidating and ' +
      'superseding Rev. Procs. 2003-43, 2004-48, and 2007-62).',
      'General window: the completed Form 2553 must be filed within 3 years ' +
      'and 75 days of the intended effective date. The time limit does NOT ' +
      'apply (Rev. Proc. 2013-30, §5.04) when: the corporation is not also ' +
      'seeking a late entity-classification election; it failed to qualify ' +
      'solely because Form 2553 was not timely filed; the corporation and ' +
      'every shareholder reported consistently with S status for the first ' +
      'intended year and every year since; at least 6 months have passed ' +
      'since the corporation filed its return for that first year; and ' +
      'neither the corporation nor any shareholder was notified by the IRS ' +
      'of a problem with the S status within 6 months of that timely filed ' +
      'return. A client who has filed 1120-S for years with no IRS notice ' +
      'usually fits, however old the missed election.',
      'Defects other than lateness: Rev. Proc. 2022-19 lets a corporation fix ' +
      'several common S-election problems without a private letter ruling — ' +
      'non-identical governing provisions (operating-agreement language that ' +
      'looks like a second class of stock but was never acted on), missing ' +
      'shareholder consents or officer signature on Form 2553 (these are ' +
      'not treated as harmless — the procedure sends them to the existing ' +
      'late-consent and Rev. Proc. 2013-30 relief), a missing ' +
      'administrative acceptance letter, disproportionate distributions ' +
      'under identical governing provisions, and inconsistent filings. Check ' +
      'it before assuming an eligibility problem needs a PLR.',
      'Substantive tests: (1) the entity intended to be an S corporation as ' +
      'of the effective date and failed solely because the election was not ' +
      'filed timely; (2) reasonable cause for the failure and diligent action ' +
      'once discovered, stated under penalties of perjury; (3) the entity and ' +
      'ALL shareholders reported income consistently with S status for every ' +
      'year since the intended effective date; (4) shareholder statements to ' +
      'that effect are attached.',
      'Same procedure also covers late entity-classification elections that ' +
      'ride with an S election (an LLC intending S status files only Form ' +
      '2553 — the Form 8832 election is deemed made), plus late ESBT/QSST ' +
      'and QSub elections.',
      'Outside the rev proc (window blown, consistency broken), the fallback ' +
      'is a private letter ruling under §1362(b)(5) — slow and with a ' +
      'substantial user fee, which is why catching this within the window ' +
      'matters.'

    requirements: [
      'The entity was ELIGIBLE for S status continuously from the intended effective date (§1361 tests) — relief cures the paperwork, not eligibility defects.',
      'Failure to qualify is solely the late/missing Form 2553 (or companion classification election).',
      'Reasonable cause and diligent correction, stated under penalties of perjury.',
      'The entity and every shareholder filed all affected returns consistently with S status (e.g., 1120-S filed or no C-corp return filed; shareholders picked up passthrough income).',
      'Filing within 3 years and 75 days of the intended effective date — or, beyond that, meeting the §5.04 conditions (consistent S filings every year, six months since the first return, no IRS notice about the status).'
    ],
    risks: [
      'Consistency is the usual deal-breaker: if any year was filed as a C corporation, or a shareholder reported inconsistently, streamlined relief is unavailable — the PLR route is the only fallback.',
      'Relief validates the election, not the compensation: retroactive S years still need reasonable comp — expect to address unpaid-payroll exposure for those years (see the Reasonable Compensation Study strategy).',
      'A weak reasonable-cause narrative invites rejection; "we forgot" needs surrounding diligence facts.',
      'Eligibility defects in ANY covered year (ineligible shareholder, a true second class of stock) sink the whole retroactive period — though paper defects such as non-identical operating-agreement language can often be cured under Rev. Proc. 2022-19.',
      'California: no separate election — a corporation that is an S corporation federally is one for California, so federal relief carries over. File Form 100S for the covered years; the 1.5% tax ($800 minimum) applies to each of them.'

    bestFit: [
      'Clients who formed an entity, intended S status, and discover at tax time (or in an exam) that Form 2553 was never filed or was filed late.',

      'Verify the window: within 3 years + 75 days of the intended effective date, or the no-time-limit conditions of §5.04; confirm every year\'s filings (entity and all shareholders) are consistent with S status.',
      'Draft the reasonable-cause statement and collect shareholder consistency statements signed under penalties of perjury.',

    plainEnglish: [
      'The S corporation tax status that saves business owners thousands each year requires a short form filed with the IRS by a strict early-in-the-year deadline. It is one of the most commonly missed filings in small business — sometimes the form was never sent, sometimes it was sent and lost, and the owner has no idea.',
      'The good news: the IRS has an official forgiveness program. If you always intended to be an S corporation, have a reasonable explanation, and you and the company filed your taxes as if the election were in place, the IRS will generally honor the election retroactively — up to about three years back. No penalty, no fee for the request.',
