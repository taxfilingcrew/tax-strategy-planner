      'depreciation caps do not apply. A heavy SUV, pickup, or van used more ' +
      'than 50% in business can be expensed in year one: §179 up to the ' +
      'SUV-specific cap of §179(b)(5) (roughly $32,000 for 2026, indexed — ' +
      'verify), with 100% bonus depreciation under §168(k) (permanent post-' +
      'OBBBA) absorbing the remaining business-use basis. The result is a full ' +
      'first-year write-off of the business percentage of the vehicle\'s cost. ' +

      '§179(b)(5) imposes a special cap on heavy SUVs ($25,000 base, indexed — ' +
      'approximately $32,000 for 2026); pickups with a 6-ft+ bed and certain ' +
      'vans (seating 9+ behind the driver / cargo configuration) escape the ' +

      '(§168(k), permanent for property acquired after 1/19/2025) covers ' +
      'whatever §179 does not, so the full business-use share of cost is ' +

      'The acceleration is versus 5-year MACRS (autos/light trucks are 5-year ' +
      'property): later years have no depreciation left, so taxable income is ' +
      'higher than baseline in years 2–6.',
      'If business use drops to 50% or below during the recovery period, §280F(b)(2) ' +
      'recaptures the excess of accelerated depreciation over ADS straight-line ' +

      'Normally, when a business buys a vehicle, the tax deduction dribbles out over five or six years — and for regular cars, annual IRS caps stretch it out even longer. But vehicles rated over 6,000 pounds — many full-size trucks, vans, and large SUVs — play by different rules. If the vehicle is used mostly for business, the business share of the entire purchase price can usually be deducted in the first year.',
      'On a $90,000 truck used fully for business, that is a $90,000 deduction this year instead of small pieces spread over many years. In a high tax bracket, that can put $30,000 or more back in your pocket at tax time.',
      'Two honest catches. First, this is an acceleration — you are using up future years\' deductions now, so later years show more taxable income. Second, the "mostly for business" part is a real requirement with real recordkeeping: a mileage log, and business use that stays above half. We help you keep both airtight.'
