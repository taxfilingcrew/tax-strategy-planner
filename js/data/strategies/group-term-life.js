    summary:
      'Under §79, the cost of the first $50,000 of employer-provided group ' +
      'term life insurance is excluded from the employee\'s income; coverage ' +
      'above $50,000 generates imputed income at the Table I rates of ' +
      'Reg. §1.79-3(d)(2) (typically far below actual premium cost for older ' +
      'employees), and the imputed amount is FICA wages. The employer deducts ' +
      'the premiums under §162 provided it is not the beneficiary. This is a ' +
      'fringe CLEANUP item, not a headline strategy — the dollars are small ' +
      '(a few hundred dollars of premium excluded per employee) — but it is ' +
      'cheap, clean, and commonly done wrong: >2% S-corp shareholders do not ' +
      'qualify for the exclusion (§1372 partner treatment — the full cost of ' +
      'their coverage belongs on the W-2 in Boxes 1, 3 AND 5, so it bears ' +
      'Social Security and Medicare tax as well as income tax), and discriminatory plans strip key employees of ' +
      'the $50k exclusion entirely under §79(d). Advisory-only: the per-owner ' +
      'benefit is too small and too structure-dependent to model honestly ' +
      'from return inputs.',
    mechanics: [
      'Exclusion applies to GROUP term coverage under a policy carried ' +
      'directly or indirectly by the employer, generally requiring 10+ ' +
      'full-time employees or a Reg. §1.79-1 alternative for smaller groups ' +
      '(coverage for all eligible employees on a formula basis).',
      'Coverage over $50,000: imputed income = Table I uniform premium per ' +
      '$1,000 per month (age-banded) minus employee after-tax contributions; ' +
      'reported on the W-2 (Box 12 code C) and subject to FICA.',
      'Table I cost is usually well below actual premium for employees 50+, ' +
      'so even taxable excess coverage is a rate arbitrage versus buying ' +
      'term personally at those ages.',
      '§79(d) nondiscrimination: if the plan favors key employees as to ' +
      'eligibility or benefit amounts, key employees lose the $50k exclusion ' +
      'and impute income at the GREATER of Table I or actual cost.',
      'Entity mapping: C-corp owner-employees qualify like any employee; ' +
      '>2% S-corp shareholders do not: the whole cost of their coverage is ' +
      'W-2 wages AND FICA wages (Boxes 1, 3 and 5). §3121(a)(2)(C) removes ' +
      'group-term life from the FICA exclusion to the extent it is includible ' +
      'in income, and for a 2% shareholder all of it is. It is not FUTA ' +
      'wages, income tax withholding is not required, and it is not eligible ' +
      'for §162(l) (life insurance is not health insurance). Do not confuse ' +
      'this with a 2% shareholder\'s HEALTH premiums, which are Box 1 only. ' +
      'Partners/sole proprietors are not employees.',
      'Employer premiums are deductible under §162; §264(a) denies the ' +
      'deduction if the employer is directly or indirectly a beneficiary.'
