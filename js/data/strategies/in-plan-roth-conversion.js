    summary:
      'Under §402A(c)(4), a participant may convert vested pre-tax 401(k) ' +
      'balances to a designated Roth account inside the plan — including ' +
      'amounts not otherwise distributable (ATRA 2012 expansion). The converted ' +
      'amount is ordinary income in the conversion year at rates that are, ' +
      'post-OBBBA, permanent and known; everything after that grows tax-free ' +
      'with no lifetime RMDs. The strategy is deliberate bracket-filling: ' +
      'convert exactly enough to fill low brackets in the years income dips, or ' +
      'to absorb large deductions that would otherwise be wasted — a DB plan ' +
      'funding year, a cost segregation year, an NOL year. Unlike pre-2018 IRA ' +
      'conversions, it is IRREVOCABLE: there is no recharacterization, so the ' +
      'amount must be right when executed, typically in Q4 against a near-final ' +
      'projection.',
    mechanics: [
      'Mechanics: direct in-plan rollover of vested pre-tax (or employer) ' +
      'amounts to the plan\'s designated Roth account; the plan must offer ' +
      'designated Roth accounts and permit in-plan conversions (Notice 2010-84; ' +
      'Notice 2013-74 for nondistributable amounts).',
      'Tax: converted amount is ordinary income in the year of conversion; no ' +
      '10% early-distribution penalty at conversion, but amounts distributed ' +
      'within 5 years of conversion can trigger penalty recapture.',
      'No income limits, no dollar caps — the ceiling is the client\'s bracket ' +
      'tolerance, not a statute.',
      'The classic pairings this tool models elsewhere: convert in the year a ' +
      'defined benefit contribution or cost segregation loss crushes taxable ' +
      'income — the deduction absorbs the conversion income, moving pre-tax ' +
      'money to Roth at 10–22% instead of 32–37%.',
      'Watch the cascade: conversion income raises AGI, which can phase down ' +
      'the OBBBA SALT cap (over $505,000 MAGI), squeeze QBI thresholds, and ' +
      'trigger IRMAA two years later for Medicare-age clients — fill brackets ' +
      'net of these cliffs, not gross.',
      'No recharacterization (TCJA repealed it): the election is irrevocable — ' +
      'convert against a solid year-end projection, and consider splitting ' +
      'across December/January to straddle uncertainty.'

      'The money in your pre-tax retirement account has a tax bill attached — the IRS just hasn\'t collected it yet. When you retire, every withdrawal is taxed, and once required withdrawals begin in your seventies, the government decides how much comes out and gets taxed each year, not you.',
      'A conversion flips that. You choose an amount of pre-tax money, pay tax on it now, and move it to the tax-free side of your plan — where it grows forever untaxed, with no forced withdrawals. The power move is picking WHICH year to do it: a year when your income dips, or a year when a big deduction (like a large retirement plan contribution or a real estate deduction) has already pushed your tax rate way down. In those years, money that would eventually be taxed at high rates gets taxed at bargain rates instead.',
      'We size the amount precisely — enough to use up your low tax brackets, not a dollar more. One thing to know going in: once a conversion is done, it cannot be undone, which is why we run it against near-final numbers late in the year.'
