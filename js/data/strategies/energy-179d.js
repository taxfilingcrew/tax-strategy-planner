    summary:
      'DEADLINE FIRST: OBBBA (P.L. 119-21) TERMINATED §179D for property ' +
      'whose construction begins after June 30, 2026 — this is a ' +
      'use-it-or-lose-it window, and "begins construction" is the operative ' +
      'test. §179D allows an immediate deduction for energy-efficient ' +
      'commercial building property (interior lighting, HVAC/hot water, ' +
      'envelope) placed in service in a commercial building or a ' +
      'residential building 4+ stories. The deduction is a sliding scale ' +
      'per square foot keyed to modeled energy savings vs. an ASHRAE 90.1 ' +
      'baseline — for 2026, $0.59–$1.19/sqft at the base rate, ' +
      'multiplied 5x to $2.97–$5.94/sqft when prevailing wage and ' +
      'apprenticeship (PW&A) requirements are met (Rev. Proc. 2025-32). ' +
      'Because government and tax-exempt building owners ' +
      'cannot use it, they may ALLOCATE the deduction to the designer ' +
      '(architect/engineer/design-build contractor) — a major benefit for ' +
      'design firms. The deduction reduces the building property\'s basis, ' +
      'so it is an acceleration against 39-year depreciation, not new money.',
    mechanics: [
      'Qualifying systems: interior lighting, HVAC and hot water, and ' +
      'building envelope, certified by a qualified individual using ' +
      'IRS-approved energy modeling software against the applicable ASHRAE ' +
      '90.1 reference standard.',
      'Sliding scale: the per-sqft rate starts at 25% modeled energy-cost ' +
      'savings and climbs with each additional percentage point of savings ' +
      'to the maximum. Meeting PW&A quintuples the rate. 2026 amounts: $0.59 ' +
      'base floor to $5.94 PW&A cap per sqft (Rev. Proc. 2025-32).',
      'OBBBA termination: no §179D deduction for property the construction ' +
      'of which begins after 6/30/2026. Projects already under construction ' +
      'by that date remain eligible when placed in service.',
      'Designer allocation: government and tax-exempt owners may allocate ' +
      'the deduction to the primary designer via a written allocation ' +
      'letter (§179D(d)) — architects and engineers with public-sector work ' +
      'should sweep open years.',
      'Basis reduction: the deduction reduces the energy property\'s ' +
      'depreciable basis — the benefit is acceleration vs. 39-year ' +
      'straight-line, plus the rate arbitrage.',
      'Deduction repeats: the same building can generate additional §179D ' +
      'on later qualifying retrofits (subject to per-sqft lifetime caps ' +
      'measured over prior deductions in recent years).'

      'One limit matters most: Congress ended this deduction for projects that start construction after June 30, 2026. A project that broke ground on or before that date keeps its eligibility; a project starting now does not qualify. California does not allow this deduction on the state return.',
