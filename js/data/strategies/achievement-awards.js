    summary:
      'One of the few remaining double benefits in compensation: a qualifying ' +
      'employee achievement award is deductible to the employer under §274(j) ' +
      'AND excluded from the employee\'s income under §74(c) — no income tax, ' +
      'no FICA on either side. The rules are narrow and mechanical: TANGIBLE ' +
      'PERSONAL PROPERTY (never cash, gift cards, or their equivalents — the ' +
      'TCJA wrote that into §274(j)(3)(A)(ii)) awarded for LENGTH OF SERVICE ' +
      'or SAFETY ACHIEVEMENT as part of a meaningful presentation. The ' +
      'deduction/exclusion cap is $400 per employee per year for nonqualified ' +
      'awards, $1,600 where the awards are made under a written qualified plan ' +
      'that does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees ' +
      'AND whose awards average $400 or less for the year — so $1,600 is the ' +
      'ceiling on one award, not a budget for every honoree. ' +
      'Advisory: the dollars are small per employee, but across a workforce it ' +
      'beats a taxable bonus dollar-for-dollar and builds retention structure.',
    mechanics: [
      'Definition (§274(j)(3)(A)): an item of tangible personal property, ' +
      'awarded for length of service or safety achievement, given as part of a ' +
      'meaningful presentation, and not disguised compensation.',
      'TCJA codified the exclusions: cash, cash equivalents, gift cards/' +
      'coupons/certificates (except arrangements limited to selecting from ' +
      'employer-preselected tangible items), vacations, meals, lodging, ' +
      'tickets, and securities do NOT qualify.',
      'Limits: $400/employee/year for nonqualified awards; $1,600 aggregate ' +
      '(qualified + nonqualified) when paid under a QUALIFIED PLAN — a written, ' +
      'established program that does not discriminate in favor of highly ' +
      'compensated employees and whose average award cost does not exceed $400. ' +
      'The average counts every qualified-plan award the employer makes in ' +
      'the year (awards of nominal value are left out). Give five employees ' +
      '$1,600 each and the average is $1,600: the plan is not a qualified ' +
      'plan and each award falls back to the $400 limit. One $1,600 award ' +
      'needs several small ones beside it — for example one at $1,600 and ' +
      'six at $200 average $400.',
      'Length-of-service timing rules (§274(j)(4)(B)): no award within the ' +
      'employee\'s first 5 years, and not more often than every 5 years for ' +
      'the same employee.',
      'Safety-achievement limits (§274(j)(4)(C)): fails if awarded to a ' +
      'manager, administrator, clerical, or other professional employee, or if ' +
      'more than 10% of eligible employees receive safety awards in the year.',
      'Employment-tax alignment: amounts excludable under §74(c) are also ' +
      'excluded from FICA wages (§3121(a)(20)) — the exclusion is complete, ' +
      'not just income-tax.'

      'Length-of-service awards inside the first 5 years, or more often than every 5 years, fail entirely.',
      '"Safety awards" to owners, managers, or office staff fail by statute — this prong is for the field workforce.',

      'Almost anything you give an employee is taxable to them — bonuses, gift cards, even a turkey certificate. There is one carve-out the tax law still allows: real, physical gifts given to recognize years of service or safety milestones. Done right, the business deducts the cost, and the employee owes nothing. Not even payroll tax.',
      'The rules are picky but easy to follow once set up. The gift must be an actual item — a watch, quality tools, equipment they would love — never cash or a gift card. It has to mark a real milestone, like five or ten years with you. And it should be presented properly, at a team lunch or company meeting, not slipped into a paycheck.',
      'With a simple written plan, a single award can be worth as much as $1,600, as long as the awards you give in a year average $400 or less — think one standout gift for a 25-year veteran alongside more modest ones for five-year milestones. Compare that to a bonus, where a $1,600 gesture costs you payroll taxes and leaves the employee with maybe $1,100 after withholding. Same generosity, better math, and honestly — a watch presented in front of the team beats a line on a paystub.'
