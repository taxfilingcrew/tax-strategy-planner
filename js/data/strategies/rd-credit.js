    summary:
      'The §41 credit for increasing research activities is a permanent, ' +
      'dollar-for-dollar general business credit for qualified research ' +
      'expenses (QREs) — wages, supplies, and 65% of contract research — that ' +
      'satisfy the §41(d) four-part test. Computed on Form 6765 under the ' +
      'regular method or the 14% alternative simplified credit (ASC). §280C(c) ' +
      'requires either adding the credit back to income or electing the ' +
      'reduced credit (credit × (1 − 21%)); the advisor enters the NET credit ' +
      'here. OBBBA (P.L. 119-21) enacted §174A restoring immediate expensing ' +
      'of domestic research costs from 2025, ending the TCJA-era 5-year ' +
      'domestic amortization — foreign research remains 15-year. Qualified ' +

      'against payroll tax under §41(h).',
    mechanics: [
      'QREs are in-house research wages, supplies used in research, and 65% ' +
      'of contract research amounts (75% for qualified research consortia) — ' +

      'all activities constitute a process of experimentation.',
      'Two computation methods on Form 6765: regular (20% of QREs over a ' +
      'base amount) or the alternative simplified credit (14% of QREs over ' +
      '50% of the prior-3-year average QREs). Most established claimants use ASC.',
      '§280C(c): the deduction attributable to credited expenses must be ' +

      '(including extensions) election on Form 6765. Enter the post-§280C net ' +
      'figure in this tool; the model does not separately un-deduct wages.',

      'receipts in the credit year and no gross receipts before the 5-year ' +
      'period ending with the credit year — elect up to $500,000 against ' +
      'payroll taxes, valuable for pre-profit startups with no income tax to offset.',

    requirements: [
      'Domestic research activities that satisfy all four prongs of §41(d) — documented at the business-component level.',
      'Contemporaneous documentation: project lists, wage allocations by employee, experimentation records (design iterations, test logs, versions).',

    ],
    risks: [
      'The IRS actively targets credit mills that sell studies claiming inflated wage percentages with no experimentation evidence — R&D claims have appeared in IRS Dirty Dozen warnings. Exam risk is documentation risk.',
      'Recent Form 6765 revisions demand more granular business-component reporting; thin studies that could hide behind a single number no longer can.',
      'The credit is nonrefundable against income tax (this tool applies it after the child tax credit); unused amounts carry back 1 year and forward 20 under §39 (the tool carries unused credit forward within the projection). For a pass-through owner the credit is further limited to the tax on income from that business (§41(g)).',
      'Funded research (paid by a customer or grant with rights/payment contingencies) and research after commercial production do not qualify — common overclaim areas.',
      'Missing the §280C(c) election on the original return forces the deduction add-back, which is generally worse for pass-through owners in top brackets.'
    ],
    bestFit: [
      'Businesses developing or materially improving products, software, processes, or formulas with U.S.-based technical staff.',
      'Pre-revenue or low-income startups (under $5M receipts) that can monetize the credit against payroll tax immediately.',
      'Owners already paying for engineering, development, or lab work who have never had a formal credit study.'

    implementation: [
      'Scope qualified activities against the §41(d) four-part test; rule out funded research and post-commercial-production work.',
      'Commission or prepare a credit study: identify business components, allocate W-2 wages, supplies, and contract research (65%).',
      'Choose regular vs. ASC method; run both in the study and pick the larger sustainable credit.',
      'Make the §280C(c) reduced-credit election on Form 6765 with the timely-filed original return (do not miss this deadline).',
      'If a qualified small business, elect the §41(h) payroll offset on Form 6765 and claim it on Form 8974 with Form 941.',
      'Retain the study, wage allocations, and experimentation records in the permanent file for exam support.'

Manufacturers refining a production process, contractors engineering solutions to site problems, and companies building software all commonly qualify. What matters is that your team is solving technical problems by testing and refining, and that we can document it.',
