      'A Schedule C proprietor deducts business use of a personal vehicle under ' +
      '§162 using either the standard mileage rate (2026: $0.725/mile Jan–Jun, ' +
      '$0.76/mile Jul–Dec after the midyear increase) or ' +
      'actual expenses (fuel, insurance, repairs, depreciation) multiplied by ' +
      'the business-use percentage. The election matters: standard mileage must ' +
      'be chosen in the FIRST year the vehicle is available for business use to ' +
      'preserve the option to alternate later (Rev. Proc. 2019-46); claiming ' +
      'MACRS or §179 in year one locks the vehicle into actual expenses for ' +
      'life. Either way, §274(d) strict substantiation — a contemporaneous ' +
      'mileage log — is non-negotiable. This is the sole-proprietor version; ' +
      'an entity owner should be reimbursed through an accountable plan rather ' +

      'miles driven Jan 1–Jun 30 and $0.76/mi for Jul 1–Dec 31, so the log must ' +
      'split miles by half-year. ' +
      'The rate bundles depreciation, fuel, insurance, and repairs; parking and ' +
      'tolls are deductible on top. Not available if 5+ vehicles are used ' +
      'simultaneously (fleet), or after MACRS/§179/bonus was claimed on the vehicle.',
      'Actual expenses: total operating costs plus depreciation (subject to the ' +
      '§280F luxury-auto caps for passenger autos ≤6,000 lbs GVWR) × the ' +
      'business-use percentage (business miles ÷ total miles).',
      'First-year election rule (Rev. Proc. 2019-46): using standard mileage in ' +
      'year one deems straight-line depreciation and preserves the right to ' +
      'switch to actual (straight-line only) later; starting with actual + ' +
      'accelerated depreciation forecloses standard mileage for that vehicle permanently.',
      'A per-mile depreciation component of the standard rate (set annually by ' +
      'IRS notice; roughly $0.33–$0.35/mi in recent years — verify the 2026 ' +
      'figure) reduces the vehicle\'s basis and can generate gain on sale or ' +
      'trade-in once basis is exhausted.',
      '§274(d) strict substantiation: date, mileage, destination, and business ' +
      'purpose of each trip, recorded at or near the time. Estimates and ' +
      'year-end reconstructions are disallowed on exam — the Cohan rule does ' +
      'not apply to listed property.',
      'Commuting between home and a regular work location is personal and never ' +
      'deductible; a qualifying home office (principal place of business) ' +
      'converts trips from home to client sites into business miles.'

      'If business use of a vehicle depreciated under MACRS drops to 50% or below, §280F recaptures the excess over straight-line.'

      'When you use your own car for business — driving to clients, job sites, suppliers — the IRS lets you deduct it two different ways. The simple way pays you a flat rate for every business mile (72.5 cents for January through June 2026, 76 cents from July) in 2026. The detailed way deducts the business share of what the car actually costs you: gas, insurance, repairs, and wear-and-tear.',
      'Which one wins depends on your car and your driving. Lots of miles in an economical car? The flat rate usually pays more. An expensive vehicle driven fewer miles? The actual-cost method often wins. The catch is that the choice you make in the first year can lock you in, so it pays to do the math up front rather than guess.',
