    summary:
      'The partnership or S corporation elects to pay state income tax at the ' +
      'entity level. The entity deducts that tax against ordinary income under ' +
      '§164 with no SALT cap (the §164(b)(6) cap applies only to individuals), and ' +
      'the owner receives a state credit (or income exclusion) for the tax paid. ' +
      'IRS blessed the structure in Notice 2020-75. Post-OBBBA the individual SALT ' +
      'cap is $40,400 (2026) but phases back toward $10,000 once MAGI exceeds ' +
      '$505,000 — so PTET remains highly valuable for high-income owners.',
    mechanics: [
      'Entity makes the state PTET election (annual in most states; some require ' +
      'elections or estimated payments by specific deadlines — calendar them).',
      'Entity pays state tax on its passthrough income and deducts it as a ' +
      'non-separately-stated expense, reducing federal K-1 ordinary income.',
      'Owner claims the state credit (e.g., CA, NY) or excludes the income ' +
      '(e.g., WI approach) on the personal state return — state mechanics vary.',
      'Federal benefit ≈ PTET paid × owner\'s marginal federal rate, net of any ' +
      'QBI interaction (the deduction also reduces §199A qualified business income).',
      'Interplay with the individual SALT cap: below the OBBBA phase-down range, ' +
      'compare against what the owner could deduct personally; above $600k MAGI ' +
      'the personal cap is back at $10,000 and PTET is nearly always favorable.'

    implementation: [
      'Confirm the state\'s PTET regime, rate, and election deadline.',
