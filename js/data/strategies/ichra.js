    summary:
      'An Individual Coverage HRA — created by the 2019 tri-agency final ' +
      'regulations (Treasury/DOL/HHS) — lets an employer of ANY size reimburse ' +
      'employees for individual-market health insurance premiums and §213(d) ' +
      'medical expenses, tax-free to the employee and deductible to the ' +
      'business, with NO statutory dollar cap. The ACA integration problem is ' +
      'solved by requiring each covered employee to actually be enrolled in ' +
      'individual-market coverage (or Medicare). Employers may vary the ' +
      'benefit across defined employee classes (full-time/part-time, salaried/ ' +
      'hourly, geographic rating area, seasonal, etc.), but within a class the ' +
      'offer must be on the same terms, and no employee may be offered a ' +
      'choice between the ICHRA and a traditional group plan. As with all ' +
      '§105/§106 arrangements, self-employed individuals, partners, and >2% ' +
      'S-corp shareholders cannot participate tax-free — C-corp owner-employees ' +
      'can. Modeled benefit here is the employer\'s deduction for reimbursements.',
    mechanics: [
      'Employer sets a monthly/annual reimbursement allowance per class; ' +
      'employees substantiate individual-market enrollment and expenses; ' +
      'reimbursements are excluded under §106/§105(b) and deductible under §162.',
      'No dollar cap (unlike QSEHRA) and no employer-size limit — an ICHRA ' +
      'can even satisfy an applicable large employer\'s §4980H offer-of-coverage ' +
      'obligation if the allowance makes individual coverage "affordable."',
      'Permitted classes come from the regulations (Reg. §54.9802-4): e.g., ' +
      'full-time, part-time, seasonal, salaried, non-salaried, geographic ' +
      'rating area, waiting-period employees. Minimum class sizes apply to ' +
      'certain classes when a traditional group plan is offered to another ' +
      'class, to prevent risk-shifting to the exchanges.',
      'Employees offered an affordable ICHRA lose premium tax credit ' +
      'eligibility; employees must be allowed to opt out annually to preserve ' +
      'a PTC claim if the offer is unaffordable.',
      'Amounts vary within a class only by age (up to a 3:1 ratio, tracking ' +
      'individual-market pricing) and family size.',
      'Owner participation: C-corp owner-employees participate tax-free like ' +
      'any employee; >2% S-corp shareholders (§1372 partner treatment) and ' +
      'Schedule C owners/partners cannot — their side routes through §162(l) ' +
      'instead.'

    risks: [
      'Substantiation failures (reimbursing employees who dropped their individual coverage) make reimbursements taxable and threaten plan status.',

      'Employees lose premium tax credits under an affordable offer — for low-wage workforces the ICHRA can be worth less to employees than the subsidies they give up. Model the workforce before switching.',

    implementation: [
      'Survey the workforce: current coverage, wage levels, and PTC exposure — decide whether an ICHRA beats group coverage or a QSEHRA.',
      'Design classes strictly from the permitted list; set allowances (age/family-size curves permitted); check minimum class sizes if any group plan remains.',
