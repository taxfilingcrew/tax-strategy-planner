    summary:
      'A §664 charitable remainder trust converts a low-basis appreciated asset ' +
      'into a lifetime (or term) income stream without a taxable sale. The donor ' +
      'contributes the asset to the CRT; the trust — exempt from income tax under ' +
      '§664(c) — sells it and recognizes no gain, reinvesting 100% of the ' +
      'proceeds. The donor receives an annuity (CRAT) or a fixed percentage of ' +
      'annually revalued assets (CRUT), taxed under the four-tier worst-in-' +
      'first-out ordering of §664(b): ordinary income first, then capital gain, ' +
      'then other/tax-exempt income, then tax-free basis. A partial charitable ' +
      'deduction equals the actuarial remainder value, which must be at least ' +
      '10% of the contribution. Timing is the critical exam issue: the asset ' +
      'must be contributed BEFORE any binding sale obligation exists, or ' +
      'assignment-of-income doctrine taxes the gain to the donor anyway. ' +
      'Commonly paired with an irrevocable life insurance trust ("wealth ' +
      'replacement") so heirs are made whole for the remainder passing to ' +
      'charity.',
    mechanics: [
      'No gain on sale: the CRT is tax-exempt (§664(c)); it sells the ' +
      'appreciated asset and reinvests the full pre-tax proceeds. The gain is ' +
      'not eliminated — it is deferred and distributed over the payout term ' +
      'through the four-tier ordering.',
      'Four-tier WIFO taxation of distributions (§664(b)): (1) ordinary ' +
      'income (current + accumulated), (2) capital gains, (3) other income ' +
      '(e.g., tax-exempt), (4) return of corpus. The trapped LTCG typically ' +
      'flows out in tier 2 over many years — spreading and often lowering the ' +
      'rate versus a lump-sum sale.',
      'CRUT vs. CRAT: a unitrust pays a fixed percentage (5%–50%) of assets ' +
      'revalued annually — payments grow with the portfolio and additional ' +
      'contributions are allowed. An annuity trust pays a fixed dollar amount ' +
      'set at funding — no additions, and it must pass the 5% probability-of-' +
      'exhaustion test. CRUTs dominate in practice, especially in low-§7520 ' +
      'environments.',
      'Deduction: present value of the charitable remainder (Form 5227 ' +
      'regime; §170(f)(2)(A)), computed with the §7520 rate; the remainder ' +
      'must be ≥10% of initial FMV (§664(d)(1)(D) CRAT / §664(d)(2)(D) CRUT). ' +
      'Appreciated-stock contributions are subject to the 30%-of-AGI ceiling ' +
      'with a 5-year carryforward. From 2026 two OBBBA limits shave the ' +
      'deduction: only the part of a year\'s itemized charitable gifts above ' +
      '0.5% of AGI counts, and for a 37%-bracket donor itemized deductions ' +
      'are worth at most 35 cents on the dollar. Model the deduction net of ' +
      'both.',
      'Funding timing: contribute before any legally binding sale agreement. ' +
      'Under the anticipatory assignment-of-income doctrine, a donor who ' +
      'contributes after the sale is effectively locked in is taxed on the ' +
      'gain personally. Rev. Rul. 78-197 states the IRS\'s test — proceeds are ' +
      'taxed to the donor if the donee is legally bound, or can be compelled, ' +
      'to sell at the time of the gift — but it is not a safe harbor the ' +
      'courts are bound by. In Estate of Hoensheid v. Commissioner, T.C. ' +
      'Memo. 2023-34, the donor was taxed on the whole gain although no ' +
      'binding obligation existed, because by the time the shares were ' +
      'transferred the sale was "virtually certain" (price agreed, approvals ' +
      'given, bonuses paid out). Fund the trust before a letter of intent ' +
      'and before terms are settled, not merely before the purchase ' +
      'agreement is signed.',
      'S-corporation stock cannot go into a CRT: a charitable remainder ' +
      'trust is not an eligible S-corporation shareholder (Rev. Rul. 92-48), ' +
      'so the transfer terminates the S election. For an S corp the workable ' +
      'routes are a contribution of ASSETS by the corporation itself to a ' +
      'term-of-years CRT (20 years maximum, with built-in-gains and ' +
      'unrelated-business-income issues to clear), or a sale first.',
      'Wealth replacement: the income stream (or the tax saved) funds premiums ' +
      'on survivorship life insurance inside an ILIT sized to the remainder — ' +
      'heirs receive insurance proceeds estate-tax-free; charity receives the ' +
      'trust remainder.'

      'You also get a charitable deduction the year you fund it, and you spread the tax on the gain over many years of payments instead of one painful bill. Many families use part of the income to fund a life insurance policy so their children ultimately receive just as much — the charity\'s share comes from the tax savings, not from the kids.'
