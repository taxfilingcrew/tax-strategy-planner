    summary:
      'Since TCJA, §1031 applies ONLY to real property — for exchanges completed ' +
      'after 12/31/2017, equipment and vehicle trade-ins are fully taxable ' +
      'dispositions. A trade-in is now a sale at the trade-in allowance: gain ' +
      '(usually §1245 ordinary recapture on depreciated equipment) is recognized ' +
      'in full, and the replacement asset takes a full cost basis. The federal ' +
      'sting is usually neutralized because 100% bonus depreciation (§168(k), ' +
      'permanent under OBBBA) or §179 expenses the replacement in the same year ' +
      '— but the offset is not automatic and fails in specific pockets: ' +
      'PASSENGER VEHICLES, whose first-year write-off is capped by §280F at ' +
      'roughly $20,000 while the trade-in gain is taxed in full; states ' +
      'that decouple from bonus/§179 (California allows no bonus and only ' +
      '$25,000 of §179); recapture landing as ordinary income while ' +
      'the client expected deferral; and cash purchases late in a loss year. ' +
      'This entry exists to correct stale pre-2018 client expectations and to ' +
      'flag the pockets where the "wash" is not a wash.',
    mechanics: [
      'TCJA (P.L. 115-97) amended §1031(a)(1) to "real property" only, for ' +
      'exchanges completed after 12/31/2017. Equipment, vehicles, machinery, ' +
      'aircraft, and other personal property no longer qualify.',
      'An equipment trade-in is bifurcated: (1) a sale of the old asset at the ' +
      'trade-in allowance — gain up to prior depreciation is §1245 ordinary ' +
      'recapture; and (2) a purchase of the new asset at full invoice price.',
      'The federal offset: the replacement is typically eligible for 100% bonus ' +
      'depreciation (§168(k)) or §179 expensing ($2,560,000 limit / $4,090,000 ' +
      'phase-out, 2026), so the year-one deduction usually equals or exceeds the ' +
      'recognized recapture — net federal effect near zero when the replacement ' +
      'costs at least as much as the trade-in allowance.',
      'The offset FAILS for cars and light trucks: a passenger automobile ' +
      '(6,000 lb gross vehicle weight or less) is a §280F luxury auto, with ' +
      'depreciation including bonus limited to about $20,000 in each of the ' +
      'first two years, about $12,000 in the third and about $7,000 a year ' +
      'after that (indexed; see the annual revenue procedure). Trade a fully depreciated $45,000 ' +
      'car for a $60,000 one: $45,000 of recapture is ordinary income this ' +
      'year, the deduction on the new car is about $20,000, and the rest ' +
      'comes over the following years. Vehicles over 6,000 lb are outside the ' +
      'cap (see Heavy Vehicle §179).',
      'California: no bonus depreciation and a $25,000 §179 limit, so for the ' +
      'state the recapture is taxed now and the replacement is depreciated ' +
      'over its life. California also adopted the real-property-only rule ' +
      'for exchanges after January 10, 2019 only for taxpayers above ' +
      '$250,000 of AGI ($500,000 joint or head of household); a taxpayer ' +
      'below that could still defer an equipment exchange for California, ' +
      'leaving different federal and state basis. Confirm that exception is ' +
      'still in the current FTB instructions before relying on it.',
      'The offset FAILS at the state level in nonconformity states: several ' +
      'states disallow or severely limit bonus depreciation (and some cap §179), ' +
      'so the recapture is taxed currently while the replacement deduction ' +
      'spreads over the state depreciation life.',
      'Character mismatch: recapture is ordinary income (no LTCG rates), it ' +
      'increases AGI-driven phase-outs, and for a Schedule C it lands on Form ' +
      '4797 (not subject to SE tax, but fully ordinary).',
      'Real property exchanges still fully qualify — 45-day identification, ' +
      '180-day closing, qualified intermediary. Do not let the equipment rule ' +
      'bleed into real-estate expectations, and note Reg. §1.1031(a)-3 defines ' +
      'real property broadly (including certain inherently permanent structures).'

    teaser: 'Stops an outdated assumption from turning your next equipment trade into a tax surprise',

    plainEnglish: [
      'For decades, trading in old equipment for new was tax-free — the old machine\'s value just rolled into the new one. That rule changed in 2018: today, only real estate gets that treatment. A trade-in of equipment, trucks, or machinery now counts as a sale, and any value above what\'s left on your books is taxable income that year.',
      'The good news: current law usually lets you deduct 100% of the new equipment\'s cost in the same year. In most cases that deduction cancels out the tax on the trade-in, so the net federal result is close to zero.',
      'But "usually" isn\'t "always." Some states don\'t allow the instant write-off, and certain situations leave you with real tax due on the trade even though no cash hit your pocket. We check your specific trades and your state before you sign, so nothing surprises you at tax time.'
    ],
    analogy: 'It\'s like a store changing its exchange policy from "even swap" to "we buy your old one, you buy the new one." Most days the two receipts cancel out — but not always, so we read both receipts before you trade.',

      'No filing-season surprises on equipment and vehicle trades',

    considerations: [
      'California limits the write-off that offsets the trade, so a trade can create a real state tax bill — we quantify it first.',
      'For ordinary cars and light trucks the first-year write-off is capped, so trading one in can add to this year\'s taxable income even federally. Heavier trucks and SUVs do not have that cap.',
