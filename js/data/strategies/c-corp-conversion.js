    summary:
      'Operate the business as a C corporation taxed at the flat 21% rate (§11) ' +
      'instead of passing profit through to the owner\'s 1040. The owner takes a ' +
      'reasonable W-2 salary; remaining profit is taxed once at 21% and retained ' +
      'for reinvestment, compounding at the corporate rate rather than the ' +
      'owner\'s marginal rate. Dividends actually paid are a second tax layer at ' +
      'qualified-dividend rates (§301/§316; §1(h)(11)). The long-game payoff is ' +
      '§1202 QSBS: for stock acquired after 7/4/2025, OBBBA allows exclusion of ' +
      'up to $15M (or 10x basis) of gain — 50%/75%/100% at 3/4/5-year holds — if ' +
      'the corporation stays under the $75M gross-asset cap and runs a qualified ' +
      'active business. The trade-offs are the dividend double tax, loss of the ' +
      '§199A deduction on the corporate profit, and the §531/§541 penalty-tax ' +
      'regimes on passive or hoarded earnings.',
    mechanics: [
      'Sole-prop (or SMLLC) incorporates under §351, or an existing LLC checks ' +
      'the box (Form 8832) to be taxed as a C corporation. Owner becomes a W-2 ' +
      'employee; corporation files Form 1120.',
      'Corporate profit after salary, employer payroll tax, and admin cost is ' +
      'taxed at the flat 21% rate (§11) — no SE tax, no individual brackets, ' +
      'but also no §199A/QBI deduction on that profit.',
      'Retained earnings compound inside the corporation at the 21% rate. The ' +
      'benefit versus a passthrough is a rate spread play: it works when the ' +
      'owner\'s marginal rate (up to 37% + Medicare taxes) exceeds 21% and the ' +
      'cash genuinely stays in the business.',
      'Cash the owner pulls out beyond salary is a dividend — taxable again at ' +
      '0/15/20% qualified-dividend rates plus 3.8% NIIT (§301/§316). The ' +
      'combined double-taxed rate (~36–40% top) usually exceeds the passthrough ' +
      'rate, so the structure only wins when distributions are low.',
      '§1202 exit: original-issuance C-corp stock in a qualified trade or ' +
      'business (most non-service businesses; SSTB-type fields are excluded ' +
      'under §1202(e)(3)) with gross assets ≤ $75M at issuance. For stock ' +
      'acquired after 7/4/2025, OBBBA allows a 50% exclusion at a 3-year hold, ' +
      '75% at 4 years, 100% at 5 years, capped at the greater of $15M ' +
      '(inflation-indexed) or 10x basis per issuer.',
      'Guardrails: §541 imposes a 20% personal holding company tax where ≥60% ' +
      'of adjusted ordinary gross income is passive and 5 or fewer individuals ' +
      'own >50%; §531 imposes the 20% accumulated earnings tax on earnings ' +
      'retained beyond reasonable business needs (generally above the $250,000 ' +
      'credit; $150,000 for service corporations).'

    teaser: 'A flat, lower tax rate on profits you keep in the business — and a path to a tax-free sale someday',
    headline: 'Keep profits in the business at a 21% rate — and set up a tax-free exit',
    plainEnglish: [
      'Right now, every dollar your business earns lands on your personal tax return, where rates can run well over 30% — even for profit you never take out of the company. Restructuring as a regular corporation changes that: profit the business keeps is taxed at a flat 21%, period.',
      'That gap matters when you are reinvesting. Money kept in the company to buy equipment, hire, or build inventory grows from a bigger after-tax base every year. The catch is that money you pull out for yourself beyond your salary gets taxed a second time, so this works best when the business — not your household — needs the cash.',
      'There is also a powerful long-term prize: if you hold the company\'s stock long enough and later sell the business, current law can make millions of dollars of that sale completely tax-free. The clock starts when we set the structure up, which is a reason to plan early rather than later.'
    ],
    analogy: 'Think of it as a greenhouse for your profits: money that stays inside grows in a better climate, but every trip outside the greenhouse costs a toll — so we design it for profits you truly intend to keep planted.',
    benefits: [
      'A flat 21% rate on profits kept in the business, instead of your higher personal rate',
      'More after-tax money compounding inside the company each year',
      'A potential exit where a large part of the sale price is tax-free after a 5-year hold',
      'A salary and structure that look and feel like any established company'
    ],
    steps: [
      'We run the numbers both ways — your current setup versus the corporate structure — using your real profit and spending needs',
      'We handle the incorporation paperwork and set up your salary through payroll',
      'We document everything the future tax-free-sale rules require, starting day one',
      'Each year we review how much to pay out versus keep in, so the math keeps working for you'
    ],
    considerations: [
      'Money you take out beyond your salary is taxed twice — this structure is for owners who reinvest most of their profit, and we will be honest if that is not you.',
      'The tax-free-sale benefit requires holding the stock for years and meeting several technical tests — we set up the documentation now, but the payoff is down the road.',
      'Undoing this structure later has real costs, so we treat it as a long-term commitment, not an experiment.'
