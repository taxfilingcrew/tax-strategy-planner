    summary:
      'A §129 dependent care assistance program funded through a §125 ' +
      'cafeteria plan lets an employee pay child/dependent care with pre-tax ' +
      'salary reductions — excluded from income AND from FICA wages. OBBBA ' +
      'raised the exclusion to $7,500 ($3,750 MFS) effective 2026, the first ' +
      'increase since 1986 outside the temporary 2021 ARPA bump. The exclusion ' +
      'requires earned income of both spouses (or one full-time student/ ' +
      'incapacitated spouse), care that enables gainful employment for a ' +
      'qualifying individual (child under 13 or incapable dependent/spouse), ' +
      'and coordination with the §21 credit — dollars excluded under §129 ' +
      'reduce the §21 expense base, so for most clients above the lowest ' +
      'brackets the FSA beats the 20% credit. Business owners can sponsor a ' +
      'DCAP, but §129(d) nondiscrimination testing — including the 25% ' +
      'shareholder-concentration limit — constrains how much owners can take ' +
      'through their own plan.',
    mechanics: [
      'Employee elects up to $7,500 (2026) of salary reduction; amounts are ' +
      'excluded from Box 1 wages and from Social Security/Medicare wages — ' +
      'the FICA layer is what a simple deduction would miss.',
      'Qualifying expenses mirror §21: care for a child under 13 or a ' +
      'spouse/dependent incapable of self-care, incurred to enable the ' +
      'taxpayer (and spouse) to work — daycare, preschool, before/after ' +
      'school care, day camps. Overnight camps and K-12 tuition do not count.',
      'Exclusion is capped at the LOWER of the limit or either spouse\'s ' +
      'earned income; both spouses must work (or one be a full-time student ' +
      'or incapable of self-care).',
      '§21 coordination: excluded DCAP dollars reduce the §21 credit expense ' +
      'cap dollar-for-dollar ($3,000 one child / $6,000 two+). A $7,500 ' +
      'exclusion fully displaces the credit for one child and leaves nothing ' +
      'of the two-child cap — run the comparison, but above ~22% marginal ' +
      'rates the exclusion (income tax + FICA) beats the 20% credit.',
      'Use-it-or-lose-it: unspent balances forfeit (limited grace period if ' +
      'the plan adopts one). Election is fixed for the year absent a ' +
      'qualifying status change.',
      'Owner sponsorship: §129(d)(4) limits benefits for >5% owners (and ' +
      'spouses/dependents) to 25% of total DCAP benefits, and eligibility/ ' +
      'benefits tests apply — a solo owner with no participating employees ' +
      'generally cannot concentrate the benefit on themselves.'
