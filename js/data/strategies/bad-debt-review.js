    summary:
      'A year-end review of the receivables aging for accrual-method ' +
      'businesses: §166 allows an ordinary deduction for business debts that ' +
      'became wholly worthless during the year, and — for business debts only ' +
      '— partially worthless debts to the extent charged off on the books. ' +
      'The income was already recognized when the receivable was accrued, so ' +
      'writing off the uncollectible balance simply stops the business from ' +
      'paying tax on money it will never see. Cash-method businesses get no ' +
      'deduction for unpaid invoices — the income was never recognized — which ' +
      'is why this review belongs on every accrual client\'s year-end ' +
      'checklist and no cash client\'s.',
    mechanics: [
      '§166(a)(1): wholly worthless business debts are deductible in the year ' +
      'worthlessness occurs — a facts-and-circumstances determination ' +
      '(debtor insolvency/bankruptcy, disappearance, failed collection efforts, ' +
      'lapse of time). No formal charge-off is required for total worthlessness, ' +
      'but booking it is best practice.',
      '§166(a)(2): PARTIALLY worthless business debts are deductible only up ' +
      'to the amount actually charged off on the books during the year — the ' +
      'specific charge-off is a statutory prerequisite (Reg. §1.166-3).',
      'Basis requirement (§166(b); Reg. §1.166-1(d), with the prior-inclusion rule in §1.166-1(e)): the deduction is limited to basis ' +
      'in the debt. Accrual receivables have basis (the income was recognized); ' +
      'a cash-method taxpayer\'s unbilled or unpaid revenue has none.',
      'Worthlessness is evidenced by objective facts: collection letters, ' +
      'agency referrals, judgments returned unsatisfied, debtor bankruptcy ' +
      'filings. Legal action is NOT required where the surrounding facts show ' +
      'it would not result in collection (Reg. §1.166-2(b)).',
      'Specific charge-off is the only method for most taxpayers — the reserve ' +
      'method was repealed for non-bank taxpayers in 1986. Book reserves for ' +
      'doubtful accounts are not deductible; only identified, charged-off ' +
      'accounts are.',
      'Recovered amounts previously deducted are income in the recovery year ' +
      '(tax-benefit rule) — no amended return.'

    risks: [

      'Classify wholly vs. partially worthless; book the charge-off entries BEFORE year end for partials.',
      'Deduct on the business return (Schedule C line for bad debts, or the entity return equivalent).',
      'Set up an annual Q4 aging-review cadence so worthlessness is claimed in the right year.',

A customer who went out of business, disappeared, or simply will never pay has left you taxed on phantom income.',
      'The tax law has a fix. When a receivable becomes genuinely uncollectible, you can write it off and deduct it, which takes back the income you reported but never received. The key is doing it in the right year, with a paper trail showing you tried to collect.',
