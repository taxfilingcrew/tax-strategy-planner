      'not an evergreen one. Residential clean energy (§25D) is dead for ' +
      'expenditures after 2025; the clean vehicle credits (§30D, §25E, §45W) ' +

      'and apprenticeship compliance (or for small projects under the ' +
      'exception), plus domestic-content and energy-community bonuses; basis ' +

    requirements: [
      'A project that still fits inside the surviving deadlines — verified against current statute and Treasury begun-construction guidance, not marketing materials.',
      'For 30% on 1 MW+ projects: prevailing wage and apprenticeship compliance documented from the start of construction.',
      'For §30C: only charging property placed in service on or before 6/30/2026, in an eligible census tract — nothing installed later qualifies.',
      'Ownership with tax appetite (nonrefundable credit) or a §6418 transfer plan; basis-reduction and recapture tracking.',
      'FEOC supply-chain screening for projects starting construction in 2026 or later.'
    ],
    risks: [
      'DEADLINE RISK DOMINATES: a project that slips past the begun-construction or placed-in-service date gets ZERO credit. Interconnection queues, permitting, and equipment lead times are the real constraint — build slack into the schedule.',
      'Begun-construction standards (physical work of a significant nature / 5% cost safe harbor, with continuity) have been tightened by post-OBBBA guidance — do not rely on a token deposit to lock the date.',
      'PWA foot-faults on 1 MW+ projects drop the credit from 30% to 6% — a five-fold haircut; use contractors with documented compliance programs.',
      'Recapture if the property is sold or ceases to qualify within 5 years; basis reduction (50% of credit) trims the depreciation benefit clients expect.',
      'FEOC rules can disqualify otherwise-eligible projects based on panel/battery sourcing.',
      'Vendor hype: expect aggressive "act now" sales pitches — verify every deadline claim against the statute before the client signs.'
    ],
    bestFit: [
      'Businesses already planning rooftop solar or on-site generation that can realistically start construction or be in service inside the windows.',
      'Fleet operators who placed charging infrastructure in service by 6/30/2026 in an eligible census tract and have not yet claimed §30C.',

    implementation: [
      'Date-check the project first: can it genuinely begin construction by the §48E deadline (or be placed in service by end-2027)? If not, stop — do not model a credit.',
      'Lock begun-construction status properly: significant physical work or the 5% cost safe harbor, with a continuity plan, documented contemporaneously.',
      'For 1 MW+ projects, put PWA compliance in the EPC contract with audit rights; for <1 MW, document the exemption.',
      'Screen equipment sourcing against FEOC restrictions for 2026+ starts.',
      'Compute the credit on Form 3468; reduce depreciable basis by 50% of the credit; model 5-year MACRS/bonus on the remainder.',

      'For years, the government paid businesses back up to 30% of the cost of solar panels, EV chargers, and similar energy projects. In 2025, Congress decided to wind most of that down. The credit for EV chargers ended on June 30, 2026, and the credits for home solar and electric vehicles are gone. What remains for a business comes with hard deadlines.',
      'For solar on a business building, the test is simple: the project had to start construction by July 4, 2026, or it has to be finished and running by the end of 2027. A project that meets one of those can still capture the full credit; one that misses both gets nothing.',
      'Our job is to give you the honest version: we verify the actual deadlines, whether your project can realistically meet them, and what the credit is worth after all the fine print — before you sign anything a salesperson put in front of you.'

    analogy: 'It\'s like a store closing sale: the discount is real, but only on what\'s still on the shelf — and the doors lock on a set date whether you\'re ready or not.',
    benefits: [
      'Up to 30% of a qualifying project\'s cost back as a tax credit',
      'Plus faster depreciation write-offs on most of the remaining cost',
      'Lower operating costs (energy bills) on top of the tax benefits',

    steps: [
      'We check your project against the current deadlines — the rules changed in 2025',

      'We make sure the construction timeline locks in your eligibility',
      'We claim the credit and set up the depreciation correctly'
    ],
    considerations: [
      'The deadlines are absolute — a project that slips past them earns no credit, so we only count it when the timeline is realistic.',
      'These credits shrink your depreciation somewhat and can be partly clawed back if you sell the equipment within five years — we factor both in.',
      'Be wary of high-pressure sales pitches around these deadlines; we verify every claim against the law itself.'
