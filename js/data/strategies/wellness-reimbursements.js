    summary:
      'Two very different things travel under the "wellness" label, and this ' +
      'entry exists mostly to keep clients on the right side of the line. ' +
      'LEGITIMATE: employer wellness benefits that qualify as §105/§106 ' +
      'medical care (biometric screenings, flu shots, smoking-cessation and ' +
      'disease-management programs, EAP counseling) or as de minimis fringes ' +
      '— excludable, deductible, unglamorous, and small. ILLEGITIMATE: the ' +
      'heavily promoted "wellness indemnity" or "fixed-indemnity wellness" ' +
      'schemes claiming employers can slash FICA by running employee pay ' +
      'through pre-tax premiums that boomerang back as untaxed "wellness ' +
      'payments." The IRS addressed these directly in CCA 202323006: cash ' +
      'benefits paid regardless of unreimbursed medical expense are WAGES, ' +
      'fully subject to income and employment tax, and the IRS and its Office ' +
      'of Professional Responsibility have warned promoters and preparers. ' +
      'Position: caution-first. There is a modest legitimate benefit here and ' +
      'a marketed trap next to it. Advisory-only — the legitimate dollars are ' +
      'too small and facts-dependent to model.',
    mechanics: [
      'Legitimate exclusions: employer-provided medical care under ' +
      '§105(b)/§106 includes preventive screenings, immunizations, ' +
      'smoking-cessation, and similar §213(d) care delivered through a ' +
      'compliant plan (integrated with group coverage or fitting an excepted/ ' +
      'HRA design — the same ACA market-reform analysis as any reimbursement ' +
      'arrangement).',
      'De minimis fringes (§132(e)) cover trivial wellness perks; but gym ' +
      'memberships, fitness trackers, and wellness stipends are TAXABLE wages ' +
      'in the general case — general good health is not §213(d) medical care.',
      'The scheme anatomy: employee "buys" a wellness indemnity policy by ' +
      'pre-tax salary reduction, then receives fixed cash "benefit" payments ' +
      '(often ~equal to the premium) for activities like watching a health ' +
      'video — promoters claim the round trip erases FICA on that slice ' +
      'of payroll.',
      'CCA 202323006: fixed-indemnity payments made without regard to actual ' +
      'unreimbursed §213(d) expenses are not excludable under §105(b) — they ' +
      'are wages subject to income tax withholding and FICA. The claimed ' +
      'savings are simply unpaid employment tax.',
      'Exposure for participating employers: back employment taxes, §6656 ' +
      'deposit penalties, accuracy penalties, W-2c corrections — plus ' +
      'promoter-reliance is weak protection when the promoter\'s own ' +
      'materials advertise the tax dodge.',
      'What honest wellness design looks like: benefits tied to actual ' +
      'medical care or unreimbursed expenses, run through a compliant plan, ' +
      'with taxable perks (gym stipends) simply put on the W-2.'

      'Misclassified taxable perks (gym stipends excluded from W-2s) create small but pervasive payroll errors.',

    plainEnglish: [
      'You may have been approached — by a payroll company, an association, a "benefits consultant" — with a program that sounds magical: employees join a wellness plan, complete a few easy activities, and both you and they save big on payroll taxes, at no real cost to anyone. That specific pitch is a scheme the IRS has publicly rejected. The "savings" are just unpaid payroll tax, and employers who join are on the hook for it later, with penalties.',
      'We want you to hear that from us before you hear it from an auditor. When something promises free money through payroll paperwork, it is not a strategy — it is a liability with a sales brochure.',
      'The honest version does exist, and it is worth doing at the right size: your business can provide real health-related benefits — screenings, flu shots, counseling programs, help quitting smoking — tax-free through a properly set up plan. Perks like gym memberships are great for your team too; they are simply taxable pay, and we report them correctly so they never become a problem.'
    ],
    analogy: 'If a stranger offers you a machine that turns payroll taxes into free cash, the machine is not broken — it is borrowing from a future audit. Real wellness benefits are more like a good pair of shoes: modest, useful, and they will not fall apart on you.',
