    summary:
      'The §45F credit rewards employers that provide childcare for employees. ' +
      'OBBBA (P.L. 119-21) substantially expanded it for amounts paid after ' +
      '2025: the credit is 40% of qualified childcare expenditures (50% for ' +
      'eligible small businesses), capped at $500,000 per year ($600,000 for ' +
      'eligible small businesses), with the caps indexed for inflation, plus ' +
      '10% of qualified childcare resource and referral expenditures. OBBBA ' +
      'also opened the credit to employers that contract with third-party ' +
      'providers or participate in jointly owned or pooled childcare ' +
      'arrangements — an employer no longer needs to build its own facility. ' +
      'Recapture applies if a qualified childcare facility ceases operation ' +
      'or is disposed of within 10 years. Claimed on Form 8882 as part of the ' +
      'general business credit.',
    mechanics: [
      'Qualified childcare expenditures include costs to acquire, construct, ' +
      'rehabilitate, or expand a qualified childcare facility; operating ' +
      'costs (including employee training and scholarship programs); and ' +
      'amounts paid under contract with a qualified childcare facility to ' +
      'provide services to employees.',
      'OBBBA (effective for amounts paid or incurred after 12/31/2025) raised ' +
      'the credit rate from 25% to 40% of qualified childcare expenditures — ' +
      '50% for an eligible small business — and raised the annual cap from ' +
      '$150,000 to $500,000 ($600,000 small business), indexed going forward.',
      'Eligible small business status is measured by a gross receipts test ' +
      'keyed to §448(c) (verify the OBBBA measurement window — a five-year ' +
      'average applies rather than the usual three).',
      'Pooled and intermediary arrangements now qualify: multiple small ' +
      'employers can jointly contract for childcare capacity and share the credit.',
      'No double benefit: deductions and basis must be reduced by the credit ' +
      'claimed; enter the net figure here if you have already netted, or note ' +
      'the deduction interaction in the plan.',
      'Recapture (§45F(d)): a facility that ceases to operate as a qualified ' +
      'childcare facility, or is transferred, within the first 10 years ' +
      'triggers recapture of a declining percentage of the facility credit.'

    requirements: [
      'Childcare provided through a qualified childcare facility — licensed under state/local law and compliant with its requirements — whether employer-operated, contracted, or pooled.',
      'The facility\'s principal use must be childcare (unless it is the principal residence of an in-home operator), and use cannot discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.',
      'Substantiation of qualified expenditures: contracts with providers, construction/operating cost records, enrollment records for employees\' children.',
      'Deduction/basis reduction coordinated with the credit claimed — no double benefit.'
    ],
    risks: [
      'Recapture exposure for facility owners: selling the building or shutting the center within 10 years claws back part of the credit — calendar the exposure.',
      'Licensing failures disqualify the facility; contract arrangements should warrant the provider\'s licensed status.',
      'Nondiscrimination: a program effectively limited to owners\' or executives\' children fails; document broad employee eligibility.',
      'Nonrefundable — a low-tax year pushes the credit into carryforward (the tool carries it forward within the projection).',
      'For owner-employees, childcare provided to the owner\'s own children raises reasonable-compensation and discrimination questions — structure with counsel.'
    ],
    bestFit: [
      'Employers in tight labor markets using childcare as a retention benefit — the after-credit cost of a childcare benefit is now modest.',
      'Small businesses that can join pooled or contracted arrangements without building anything.',
      'Employers with parent-heavy workforces (healthcare, manufacturing shifts, professional services).'
    ],
    implementation: [
      'Choose the delivery model: contract slots with a licensed local provider, join a pooled arrangement, or (for larger employers) build/operate a facility.',
      'Verify the provider\'s state/local license and put the childcare services contract in writing.',
      'Define an employee eligibility policy that does not favor highly compensated employees; communicate the benefit.',
      'Track qualified expenditures separately in the books; coordinate the deduction reduction with the credit.',
      'Claim on Form 8882, carried to Form 3800; retain contracts, licenses, and enrollment records.',
      'If a facility is owned: diarize the 10-year recapture window before any sale or repurposing.'
