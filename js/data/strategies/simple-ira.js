      'A §408(p) Savings Incentive Match Plan for employers with 100 or fewer ' +
      'employees: employee deferrals up to $17,000 (2026; +$4,000 catch-up at ' +
      '50+), or $18,100 (+$3,850) at an employer with 25 or fewer employees, ' +
      'plus a mandatory employer contribution — either a dollar-for-dollar ' +
      'match up to 3% of compensation or a 2% nonelective for all eligibles. ' +
      'No discrimination testing, no Form 5500, IRA-level administration. The ' +
      'trade-offs: lower limits than a 401(k), the exclusive-plan rule (no other ' +
      'plan in the same year), and a brutal 25% early-withdrawal penalty during ' +
      'a participant\'s first two years. For an owner-only business a Solo ' +
      '401(k) usually dominates; the SIMPLE shines when there is real staff and ' +
      'the owner wants a cheap, predictable plan.',
    mechanics: [
      'Employee deferrals: $17,000 (2026), plus $4,000 catch-up at 50+. An ' +
      'employer with 25 or fewer employees gets the higher SECURE 2.0 §117 ' +
      'limits automatically: $18,100, plus $3,850 catch-up. Ages 60–63: $5,250 ' +
      'catch-up at either size. SIMPLE IRA catch-up is not subject to the ' +
      'Roth-only rule for high earners.',
      'Employer funding is mandatory: 3% match (reducible to 1% in 2 of any 5 ' +
      'years) or 2% nonelective on compensation for every eligible employee.',
      'Eligibility: employees earning $5,000 in any 2 prior years and expected ' +
      'to earn $5,000 currently — broader than 401(k) eligibility; plan for it.',
      'Exclusive-plan rule (§408(p)(2)(D)): the employer may not maintain any ' +
      'other qualified plan for the same year — no stacking a SIMPLE with a ' +
      '401(k), SEP, or cash balance plan.',
      '25% early-withdrawal penalty (§72(t)(6)) instead of 10% during the ' +
      'participant\'s first 2 years, measured from first contribution.',
      'Self-employed owner: deferral + match are above-the-line deductions that ' +
      'also reduce QBI; deferrals do not reduce SE tax.'
