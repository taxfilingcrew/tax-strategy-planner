      'A Schedule C proprietor who uses part of the home exclusively and ' +

      '§280A(c) via Form 8829, or elects the Rev. Proc. 2013-13 simplified ' +
      'method ($5/sq ft, 300 sq ft max, $1,500 cap). The deduction reduces net ' +
      'Schedule C profit, saving both income tax and SE tax. "Principal place ' +
      'of business" includes a space used for administrative or management ' +
      'activities when there is no other fixed location where the taxpayer ' +
      'conducts substantial administrative work — the statutory fix that ' +
      'superseded the narrow Soliman result. This is the sole-proprietor ' +

      'accountable-plan reimbursement instead (see Accountable Plan).',

      'personal use of the space at all.',

      'the home\'s basis. Direct expenses of the office (e.g., painting that ' +
