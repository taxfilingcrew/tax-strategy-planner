    summary:
      'For inventory-carrying businesses, the inventory method is a standing ' +
      'tax lever. In a rising-cost environment, LIFO (§472) charges the ' +
      'newest, most expensive purchases to cost of goods sold, deferring the ' +
      'inflation embedded in inventory for as long as levels are maintained — ' +
      'elected on Form 970, subject to the book conformity rule of §472(c). ' +
      'Small-business taxpayers meeting the §448(c) gross-receipts test ' +
      '($32M average for 2026 per Rev. Proc. 2025-32 §4.30) have a different lever: ' +
      '§263A(i) exempts them from UNICAP, and §471(c) lets them treat ' +
      'inventory as non-incidental materials and supplies or follow their ' +
      'books instead of full absorption accounting. Larger taxpayers can ' +
      'still rationalize UNICAP through the simplified methods. Advisory: the ' +
      'benefit depends on inventory levels, cost inflation, and method ' +
      'history — a computation for the inventory workpapers, not this tool.',
    mechanics: [
      'LIFO (§472): last-in, first-out costing moves current (higher) costs ' +
      'into COGS and leaves older (cheaper) layers on the balance sheet. The ' +
      'deferral equals the LIFO reserve and persists while inventory levels ' +
      'hold; liquidating layers recaptures old cheap costs into income.',
      'Election mechanics: Form 970 with the return for the first LIFO year. ' +
      'Book conformity (§472(c), (e)(2)): a LIFO taxpayer may not report ' +
      'income to shareholders/creditors on a non-LIFO basis (supplementary ' +
      'disclosures are permitted within the regs\' limits) — the covenant-' +
      'and-banking conversation belongs BEFORE the election.',
      'Dollar-value LIFO (Reg. §1.472-8) pools inventory by dollars rather ' +
      'than units, and the inventory price index computation (IPIC) method ' +
      'lets taxpayers use published BLS indexes — dramatically simplifying ' +
      'compliance for distributors and retailers.',
      'S-corp note: a C corporation electing S status with LIFO inventory ' +
      'triggers §1363(d) LIFO recapture — the ENTIRE reserve is included in ' +
      'income on the final C-corporation return. Only the resulting increase ' +
      'in TAX is spread: four equal annual installments, interest-free, the ' +
      'first due with that final C return and the other three with the ' +
      'S corporation\'s next three returns. Sequence entity and method ' +
      'changes deliberately.',
      'UNICAP (§263A): larger taxpayers must capitalize allocable indirect ' +
      'costs (purchasing, storage, handling, overhead) into inventory. ' +
      'Small-business taxpayers under the §448(c) test are exempt (§263A(i)); ' +
      'exempt taxpayers who have been capitalizing can file an automatic ' +
      'method change and take the favorable §481(a) adjustment.',
      '§471(c) small-business options: treat inventory as non-incidental ' +
      'materials and supplies (deducted when used/consumed in operations) or ' +
      'mirror the inventory treatment in the taxpayer\'s books/applicable ' +
      'financial statements — often far simpler than tax inventory accounting, ' +
      'and sometimes faster.'

      'Deflation or falling replacement costs makes LIFO worthless or harmful; commodity-cost direction is the whole thesis.',

      'If your business carries inventory, the tax law makes you pick a method for deciding which costs count against this year\'s sales. When your costs keep rising — and for most businesses lately, they have — one method (called LIFO) lets you count your newest, most expensive purchases first. Higher costs counted now means lower profit on paper now, which means less tax now. The savings stay parked for as long as you keep normal inventory levels.',
      'Separately, smaller businesses — under $32 million in sales — qualify for a simpler deal entirely: they can skip the most burdensome inventory bookkeeping rules and use methods that match how they already track things. Businesses that never claimed that relief are often owed a catch-up deduction just for making the switch.',
      'The right answer depends on your numbers: how much inventory you hold, how fast your costs are rising, and what your bank needs to see on your financial statements. We run that math before recommending anything.'
