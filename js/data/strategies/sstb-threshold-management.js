      'Owners of specified service trades or businesses (health, law, ' +
      'accounting, consulting, financial services, athletics, performing arts — ' +
      '§199A(d)(2), Reg. §1.199A-5) lose the QBI deduction entirely once ' +
      'taxable income clears the threshold ($403,500 MFJ / $201,750 single, ' +
      '2026) plus the phase-in range. OBBBA widened the range to $150k MFJ / ' +
      '$75k single starting 2026, so the old cliff is now a longer ramp — but ' +
      'the effective marginal rate inside the ramp is still brutal: each ' +
      'incremental dollar both bears tax and strips away deduction. The play is ' +
      'to manage taxable income back under (or lower into) the range using ' +
      'above-the-line levers: retirement plan contributions, defined benefit ' +
      'plans, charitable bunching, income deferral, and filing-status review. ' +
      'For income pushed to a later year this is timing, not elimination — the ' +
      'engine models the add-back.',
    mechanics: [
      'Inside the phase-in range, the SSTB\'s QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA are all ' +
      'scaled down ratably (Reg. §1.199A-5(a)(2)); past the top of the range the ' +
      'deduction is zero. The deduction lost per dollar of taxable income makes ' +
      'the effective marginal rate in the ramp several points above the stated ' +
      'bracket rate.',
      'Threshold is measured against TAXABLE INCOME (before the QBI deduction), ' +
      'not AGI — itemized deductions and above-the-line adjustments both count ' +
      'toward getting under it.',
      'Primary levers: employer retirement contributions (401(k) deferrals, ' +
      'profit-sharing, and for large excesses a defined benefit / cash balance ' +
      'plan, which can absorb six figures for older owners), HSA contributions, ' +
      'charitable bunching (a donor-advised fund concentrates 2–3 years of giving ' +
      'into the year that needs it), and deferring income (billing/collections ' +
      'for cash-method practices, installment sales, deferred comp).',
      'Filing status check: MFS splits the threshold ($201,775 each (MFS)) and rarely ' +
      'helps, but where one spouse is the SSTB owner and the other has large ' +
      'W-2 income, comparing MFJ vs. MFS math is worth the ten minutes.',
      'Deferral is timing: income pushed out of year 1 lands in year 2 and can ' +
      'recreate the same problem there. Recurring levers (retirement plans) beat ' +
      'one-shot deferral for chronic threshold proximity — deferral shines when ' +
      'one year spikes.',
      'OBBBA also added a $400 minimum deduction (indexed) for taxpayers with at ' +
      'least $1,000 of active QBI beginning 2026 — a floor, not a planning ' +
      'target. It does NOT rescue a fully phased-out SSTB: above the phase-in ' +
      'range the SSTB is not a qualified business at all, so it produces no ' +
      'QBI to meet the $1,000 test. The minimum helps only an owner with ' +
      'active QBI from some other, non-SSTB business.'
