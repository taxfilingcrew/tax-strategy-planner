    summary:
      'Under Reg. §1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii)(A), a property whose average period of ' +
      'customer use is 7 days or less is NOT a "rental activity" for §469 — ' +
      'so the per-se passive rule never attaches. The activity is then tested ' +
      'like any business: if the owner materially participates under Reg. ' +
      '§1.469-5T(a), losses are nonpassive and offset W-2 and business income ' +
      'currently — no real estate professional status required. This is the ' +
      'high-W-2 earner\'s doorway to using cost segregation and 100% bonus ' +
      'depreciation on a short-term rental. The trade-off: providing hotel-' +
      'like substantial services can push the activity to Schedule C and ' +
      'self-employment tax.',
    mechanics: [
      'Average-stay math: total guest-occupied days ÷ number of stays. ≤7 ' +
      'days average (typical Airbnb/VRBO) means the activity is excepted from ' +
      'the rental definition under Reg. §1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii)(A); a ≤30-day ' +
      'average with significant personal services is a second doorway.',
      'Once outside the rental definition, ordinary material participation ' +
      'tests apply (Reg. §1.469-5T(a)): 500 hours; substantially all the ' +
      'participation; or >100 hours and more than any other individual ' +
      '(including cleaners, co-hosts, and property managers — count THEIR ' +
      'hours too).',
      'Self-management is the practical requirement: a full-service ' +
      'management company usually out-participates the owner and kills the ' +
      '>100-hours-and-most test.',
      'Pairs with cost segregation: STR building components (5/7/15-year) get ' +
      '100% bonus under §168(k), producing a large first-year nonpassive loss ' +
      'against high W-2 income.',
      'Absent SUBSTANTIAL services (daily cleaning during stays, meals, ' +
      'concierge), the income stays on Schedule E with no SE tax (Reg. ' +
      '§1.1402(a)-4); hotel-like services move it to Schedule C and §1402 SE ' +
      'tax — usually worth avoiding.',
      'Personal-use days matter: §280A vacation-home limits can cap losses if ' +
      'personal use exceeds the greater of 14 days or 10% of rental days.'

    implementation: [
      'Confirm the average-stay profile from platform booking data; set listing rules (e.g., 7-night max is not required — the AVERAGE governs).',
      'Structure operations so the owner materially participates: self-manage, document owner hours and all vendor hours contemporaneously.',
      'Commission the cost segregation study for the placed-in-service year; claim 100% bonus on reclassified components.',
      'Keep services below the "substantial services" line (no daily cleaning during stays, meals, or concierge) unless the Schedule C trade-off is deliberate.',

It\'s treated like a business, and if you genuinely run it yourself, its losses count against your regular income. No career change required.',
      'Combine that with an engineering study that front-loads the property\'s depreciation, and a new short-term rental can produce a very large first-year deduction against a very large salary.
