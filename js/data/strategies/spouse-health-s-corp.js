    summary:
      'A more-than-2% S corporation shareholder is treated as a partner for ' +
      'fringe benefit purposes under §1372, so health insurance premiums the ' +
      'corporation pays (or reimburses) for the shareholder are not an ' +
      'excludable fringe — they must be included in the shareholder\'s W-2 ' +
      'Box 1 wages. But the inclusion is exempt from FICA (Announcement ' +
      '92-16), and once the premiums run through wages, the shareholder ' +
      'deducts them above the line as self-employed health insurance under ' +
      '§162(l) (Rev. Rul. 91-26; Notice 2008-1). Net federal effect: the ' +
      'entity deduction and the wage inclusion wash, leaving the §162(l) ' +
      'deduction — which converts premiums the owner was paying with ' +
      'after-tax dollars into an above-the-line deduction, with zero payroll ' +
      'tax cost. The mechanics are unforgiving: premiums paid personally and ' +
      'never run through the entity and the W-2 forfeit the deduction.',
    mechanics: [
      '§1372 treats a >2% shareholder (including a spouse and other §318 ' +
      'attribution family) as a partner for fringe purposes — the §106 ' +
      'exclusion is off the table; the premiums are compensation.',
      'The corporation pays the premiums directly or reimburses the ' +
      'shareholder under a documented arrangement, deducts them as officer ' +
      'compensation, and adds them to W-2 Box 1 — NOT Boxes 3/5, because ' +
      'Announcement 92-16 exempts the inclusion from FICA.',
      'Rev. Rul. 91-26 establishes the partner/2%-shareholder premium ' +
      'framework; Notice 2008-1 confirms the §162(l) deduction works even ' +
      'when the policy is in the shareholder\'s own name, provided the ' +
      'S corp pays or reimburses the premiums and includes them in wages.',
      'The shareholder then deducts the premiums above the line under ' +
      '§162(l), limited to earned income from the business — for a >2% ' +
      'shareholder, their W-2 wages from the S corp (§162(l)(5)(A)). Wages ' +
      'must be at least the premiums for a full deduction.',
      'No deduction is allowed for any month the shareholder or spouse is ' +
      'ELIGIBLE to participate in a subsidized employer health plan — ' +
      'eligibility alone, not enrollment, kills that month (§162(l)(2)(B)).',
      'Net result vs. paying the same premiums personally: an above-the-line ' +
      'deduction at the marginal rate, no FICA on the inclusion, and no ' +
      'itemized-deduction 7.5%-AGI medical floor to fight through.'

    requirements: [
      'An S corporation paying the owner W-2 wages at least equal to the premiums (§162(l) is wage-limited for 2% shareholders).',
      'Premiums paid by the corporation, or reimbursed under a documented arrangement — never simply paid personally with no entity involvement.',

      'No month of eligibility for a subsidized employer plan through the shareholder\'s or spouse\'s other employment.'

    risks: [
      'The most common failure is procedural: premiums paid personally all year with no entity payment/reimbursement and no W-2 inclusion — the deduction is simply lost for that year (Notice 2008-1 leaves no cure after the fact).',
      'Spouse takes a job with subsidized coverage mid-year: every month of mere ELIGIBILITY disallows the deduction, even if the family never enrolls.',
      'W-2 wages below the premium level cap the deduction — coordinate with reasonable-compensation planning.',
      'Payroll providers that route the inclusion through FICA boxes create needless payroll tax; the setup must be checked the first year.',
      'IRS FAQ guidance treats the §162(l) deduction as reducing QBI for the S corp owner — the model reduces QBI once, for the entity\'s deduction of the premiums; the IRS reading can reduce it a second time at the shareholder level, which is not modeled.'

      'Instruct payroll to add annual premiums to Box 1 wages only — exempt from Social Security/Medicare boxes per Announcement 92-16.',

The tax law actually gives S-corp owners a full deduction for health premiums, but only if the paperwork flows a specific way: the company pays the premiums (or pays you back for them), the amount shows up in your W-2, and then you deduct the whole thing on your personal return.',
      'When it is set up correctly, the pieces cancel out except one: you get a full deduction for your premiums, and — thanks to a special rule — no Social Security or Medicare tax is owed on any of it. On a typical family premium, that is thousands of dollars a year in tax savings for what amounts to a bookkeeping change.',
