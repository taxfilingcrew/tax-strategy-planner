    summary:
      'A disciplined, repeating program that layers the per-donee annual ' +
      'exclusion ($19,000 in 2026, indexed), unlimited direct payments of ' +
      'tuition and medical costs under §2503(e), 529 five-year front-loading, ' +
      'and targeted use of the $15M lifetime exemption (permanent under OBBBA ' +
      'and indexed — there is no sunset to race). The scale compounds quietly: a ' +
      'married couple with three married children and six grandchildren has 12 ' +
      'donees and can move $456,000 per year with zero gift tax and zero ' +
      'exemption used. Post-OBBBA, the case for lifetime gifting is ' +
      'appreciation-shifting, income-shifting, and asset ' +
      'protection — not exemption panic — and asset selection now matters more ' +
      'than speed: carryover basis under §1015 means low-basis assets held by an ' +
      'older client are often better kept for the §1014 step-up.',
    mechanics: [
      'Annual exclusion (§2503(b)): $19,000 per donor, per donee, per year in ' +
      '2026, indexed — present-interest gifts only. A married couple gives ' +
      '$38,000 per donee, either from joint funds or via the §2513 gift-' +
      'splitting election (which requires a Form 709). 12 donees × $38,000 = ' +
      '$456,000/year, repeatable indefinitely, no exemption consumed.',
      'Unlimited exclusions stack on top: tuition paid DIRECTLY to the ' +
      'institution and medical expenses (including health insurance premiums) ' +
      'paid DIRECTLY to the provider are not gifts at all under §2503(e) — no ' +
      'dollar limit, no Form 709, and the annual exclusion remains fully ' +
      'available for the same donee. Reimbursing the child instead of paying ' +
      'the school/provider forfeits the exclusion.',
      '529 front-loading (§529(c)(2)(B)): a donor may elect to treat a lump 529 ' +
      'contribution as made ratably over five years — up to $95,000 per donor ' +
      '($190,000 per couple) per beneficiary in 2026 — moving years of ' +
      'tax-free-growth runway in one transaction. The election is made on ' +
      'Form 709; dying within the five years pulls the unratified portion back ' +
      'into the estate.',
      'Lifetime exemption gifts (§2505): larger gifts beyond the exclusions ' +
      'consume the $15M exemption but freeze value — all post-gift appreciation ' +
      'and income accrue outside the estate. With permanence, the discipline is ' +
      'to gift the RIGHT assets (high-basis, high-growth) rather than to gift ' +
      'fast.',
      'Basis is the governing trade-off: gifts take §1015 carryover basis ' +
      '(donee inherits the gain; for loss property, the loss-side basis is FMV ' +
      'at gift — the built-in loss simply evaporates), while assets held to ' +
      'death take a §1014 FMV basis. Gift cash and high-basis/high-growth ' +
      'assets; let a dying or elderly holder keep low-basis assets for the ' +
      'step-up.',
      'Income shifting rides along: gifted income-producing assets move future ' +
      'income to the donee\'s bracket — tempered by the kiddie tax for young ' +
      'donees ($2,700 unearned-income threshold in 2026).'

      'contemporaneous notices.',
      'A basis review of every non-cash asset BEFORE it is gifted — basis, ' +
      'expected appreciation, and the donor\'s health/time horizon.',

    risks: [
      'Wrong-asset gifting: moving low-basis stock out of an 80-year-old\'s ' +
      'estate that would otherwise be fully wiped clean by the step-up can ' +
      'trade a 0% estate-tax problem for a 20%+ capital-gains problem. Model ' +
      'both sides before gifting appreciated property.',
      'Overshooting: irrevocable gifts plus a long-term-care event can leave ' +
      'the donor dependent; solve retention first, gifting second.',
      'Botched present-interest mechanics: gifts to trusts without withdrawal ' +
      'rights (or without actual Crummey notices) do not qualify for the ' +
      'exclusion and silently consume exemption.',
      'Missed filings: gift-splitting and the 529 five-year election both ' +
      'REQUIRE a Form 709 even when no tax is due; unfiled returns leave ' +

      'The tax law lets each person give each recipient up to $19,000 every year with no tax, no paperwork, and no dent in your lifetime allowance. That sounds small until you multiply it. A married couple with three married kids and six grandkids has twelve people to give to — that is $456,000 every single year, completely tax-free. Do it for ten years and you have moved millions, plus all the growth those dollars earned along the way, out of your taxable estate.',
      'On top of that, tuition and medical bills you pay directly to the school or the hospital do not count as gifts at all — no limit. And college savings plans have a special feature that lets you deposit five years of gifts in one lump sum per grandchild, so the money starts growing tax-free sooner.',
      'One thing matters as much as how much you give: WHICH assets you give. Some assets are smarter to hand over now; others carry a built-in tax break for your heirs only if you keep them for life. We sort every asset into the right pile before anything moves.'
