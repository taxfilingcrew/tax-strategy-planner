    summary:
      'Concentrate several years of planned giving into a single contribution ' +
      'to a donor-advised fund (DAF): the full deduction lands in the bunch ' +
      'year — clearing the standard-deduction hurdle that swallows modest ' +
      'annual gifts — while grants to operating charities continue on the ' +
      'donor\'s normal schedule from the DAF. Funding with long-term ' +
      'appreciated stock deducts fair market value AND permanently avoids the ' +
      'built-in gain (subject to the 30% AGI limit for capital-gain property). ' +
      'Two OBBBA changes shape the 2026 math: the cash-to-public-charity 60% ' +
      'AGI limit is permanent, and — critically — a floor now disallows ' +
      'itemized charitable deductions up to 0.5% of AGI for tax years ' +
      'beginning after 2025, which further rewards concentrating gifts into ' +
      'fewer years (one floor instead of many).',
    mechanics: [
      'Bunching mechanics: with a $32,200 MFJ standard deduction (2026), a ' +
      'couple giving $10k/yr with $20k of other itemized deductions gets ' +
      'little or no marginal benefit annually. Bunching 3 years ($30k) into ' +
      'one DAF gift itemizes decisively in the bunch year and takes the ' +
      'standard deduction in the off years — more total deduction over the cycle.',
      'The DAF (a §4966(d)(2) fund at a sponsoring public charity — community ' +
      'foundations, Fidelity/Schwab/Vanguard Charitable) completes the GIFT at ' +
      'contribution: the deduction is immediate even though grants to end ' +
      'charities are advised out over years.',
      'Appreciated long-term stock: deduct FMV under §170(e) rules without ' +
      'recognizing the gain — a double benefit versus selling and giving cash. ' +
      'AGI limits: 60% for cash to public charities (OBBBA permanent), 30% for ' +
      'long-term capital-gain property; 5-year carryforward for the excess (§170(d)).',
      'OBBBA floor (tax years beginning after 12/31/2025): itemized charitable ' +
      'deductions are reduced by 0.5% of AGI. At $400k AGI that is the first ' +
      '$2,000 of gifts each year — an annual haircut that bunching pays only ' +
      'once per cycle instead of every year.',
      'Substantiation: contemporaneous written acknowledgment for gifts ≥$250 ' +
      '(§170(f)(8)); Form 8283 for noncash gifts over $500; qualified appraisal ' +
      'over $5,000 (publicly traded securities exempt from the appraisal requirement).',
      'DAF grants cannot satisfy legally binding pledges or return any benefit ' +
      'to the donor (event tickets, memberships with value) — §4967 excise ' +

If you give $10,000 a year, much of that generosity may be doing nothing for your taxes, because you would have gotten nearly the same deduction without giving a dime.',
      'The fix is timing. Instead of giving $10,000 a year for three years, you put three years of gifts — $30,000 — into a special charitable account called a donor-advised fund in a single year. That big number blows past the standard deduction and gets fully counted. In the two off years, you take the standard deduction. Your favorite charities notice nothing: the account sends them their usual gift every year, on your instructions.',
