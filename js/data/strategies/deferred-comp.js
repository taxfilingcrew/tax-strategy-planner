    summary:
      'A nonqualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plan lets an executive or ' +
      'owner elect, before services are performed, to receive compensation ' +
      'in a later year — deferring the income tax to years with lower ' +
      'expected rates (retirement, post-sale) with no qualified-plan dollar ' +
      'limits. The discipline comes from §409A: deferral elections generally ' +
      'must be made before the year the compensation is earned, distribution ' +
      'timing must be fixed up front to permissible events, and violations ' +
      'trigger immediate inclusion, a 20% additional tax, and premium ' +
      'interest. The structural catch for owners: the employer\'s deduction ' +
      'is deferred until the employee\'s inclusion (§404(a)(5)), so in a ' +
      'pass-through the owner is usually just deferring their own deduction ' +
      '— NQDC economics genuinely work for owners of C corporations (rate ' +
      'arbitrage between 21% corporate deferral cost and personal rates) or ' +
      'sellers deferring comp from an unrelated buyer. Purely advisory: the ' +
      'value depends on future rate assumptions the tool does not project.',
    mechanics: [
      'Election timing (§409A(a)(4)): the deferral election must generally ' +
      'be irrevocable before the start of the year the services are ' +
      'performed; performance-based comp gets a limited 6-months-before- ' +
      'period-end exception.',
      'Distributions (§409A(a)(2)) only on six permissible events: ' +
      'separation from service (6-month delay for specified employees of ' +
      'public companies), death, disability, a fixed date/schedule, change ' +
      'in control, or unforeseeable emergency. No haircut withdrawals, no ' +
      'acceleration.',
      'Failure cost: immediate inclusion of all vested deferrals, plus 20% ' +
      'additional tax, plus underpayment-rate-plus-1% premium interest ' +
      '(§409A(a)(1)(B)) — the practitioner\'s reason to document mercilessly. ' +
      'California adds its own 5% additional tax on the same amount (R&TC ' +
      '§17508.2), on top of regular California income tax.',
      'The plan must stay UNFUNDED and unsecured to avoid current taxation: ' +
      'constructive receipt (Reg. §1.451-2) and economic benefit doctrines ' +
      'apply; a rabbi trust works only because its assets remain reachable ' +
      'by the employer\'s general creditors.',
      'Employer side: no deduction until the employee includes the amount ' +
      '(§404(a)(5)). FICA runs on the SPECIAL TIMING rule instead — taxed ' +
      'when vested (§3121(v)(2)), often cheap if the executive is already ' +
      'over the wage base, and the later payout is then FICA-free.',
      'Owner math: in an S corp/partnership, the entity\'s deferred ' +
      'deduction is the owner\'s own deferred deduction — usually a wash or ' +
      'worse. The clean use cases are C-corp owners (corp deducts at 21% ' +
      'later; owner defers 37%-bracket income to lower-rate years) and ' +
      'owners negotiating deferred comp/consulting from an unrelated ' +
      'acquirer post-sale.',
      'The C-corp case has a cost that must be in the math: with no ' +
      'deduction until payout, the money set aside is corporate profit taxed ' +
      'NOW at 21% federal plus 8.84% California, and its earnings are taxed ' +
      'at corporate rates each year. The owner is not deferring tax on that ' +
      'income — he is swapping his 37%-plus personal rate today for roughly ' +
      '28% corporate tax today, with the personal tax and the corporate ' +
      'deduction both arriving at payout. The gain is the rate spread and ' +
      'the timing, not the whole 37%.'

    requirements: [
      'A written plan document satisfying §409A in form AND operation before any deferral election.',
      'Elections executed before the service year (calendar reminders are part of the engagement).',
      'The right taxpayer profile: C-corp owner/executive, or an owner receiving deferred amounts from an unrelated payor — not a routine S-corp owner deferring against their own K-1.',
      'Employer solvency confidence: deferred amounts are an unsecured claim; a rabbi trust mitigates change-of-heart risk, never creditor risk.'
    ],
    risks: [
      '§409A failures are ruinous relative to the benefit — immediate inclusion, 20% additional federal tax, another 5% to California, premium interest — and operational footfaults (paying 30 days early, a discretionary acceleration) count.',
      'Quoting the C-corp benefit as the owner\'s full marginal rate ignores the corporate tax (21% plus 8.84% in California) paid meanwhile on the retained funds.',
      'Credit risk is real: NQDC participants are general unsecured creditors; employer bankruptcy can wipe out decades of deferrals.',
      'Rate-assumption risk: deferring at today\'s rates to unknown future rates is a bet; legislation or a big payout year can invert it.',
      'For pass-through owners, §404(a)(5) makes the entity-side deduction wait for the inclusion — run the combined owner+entity math before assuming any benefit.',
      'State sourcing: deferred comp paid over fewer than 10 years can remain taxable by the state where it was earned even after the owner moves (4 U.S.C. §114 protects only certain periodic payments).'
    ],
    bestFit: [
      'C-corporation owner-executives in peak-rate years expecting materially lower personal rates at payout.',
      'Owners selling to an unrelated buyer who can structure post-sale deferred comp or consulting payments.',
      'Key-employee retention plans where the family business wants golden handcuffs (deduction timing is a cost, not a bar).'
    ],
    implementation: [
      'Screen the fact pattern first: entity type, expected rate path at payout, employer credit quality — decline the strategy for typical pass-through owner deferrals.',
      'Engage ERISA/exec-comp counsel to draft the §409A-compliant plan (top-hat filing with the DOL where applicable).',
      'Execute deferral elections before December 31 for next year\'s compensation; fix the distribution schedule in the election.',
      'Consider a rabbi trust for benefit security short of funding.',
      'Apply the §3121(v)(2) FICA special timing rule at vesting; track deferrals in payroll (W-2 Box 11 reporting at distribution).',
      'Audit operations annually — payments made exactly per schedule, no accelerations — and calendar the specified-employee 6-month delay if the company ever becomes public.'

    teaser: 'Lets you decide which year — and which tax rate — your biggest paydays land in',
    headline: 'Earn it now, get taxed later — on your schedule',
    plainEnglish: [
      'Normally you pay tax on compensation the year you earn it — even if that year happens to be your highest-tax year ever. A deferred compensation plan is a formal agreement, set up in advance, that part of your pay will be delivered in a later year instead: after retirement, after a business sale, or on a schedule you choose up front. You pay tax when the money arrives — ideally in years when your rate is much lower.',
      'The rules are strict and unforgiving: the decision to defer has to be made before you earn the money, the payout schedule has to be locked in from the start, and breaking the rules triggers steep penalties. This is a "set it up right or not at all" strategy, which is why it comes with real legal paperwork.',
      'One honest caveat: for most owners of S corporations and partnerships, deferring your own pay also defers your own deduction — the math usually cancels out. Where this shines is for owners of C corporations and for owners selling their business, where the deferral genuinely moves income from a 37% year into much cheaper ones. Even then, a C corporation pays its own tax (about 28% with California) on the money it holds for you in the meantime, so the saving is the difference in rates, not the whole tax.'
    ],
    analogy: 'It\'s like a dam on a river of income: instead of the whole flow hitting in flood years, you release it steadily into the years where it does the least damage.',
