      'A chart-of-accounts and documentation cleanup that captures the meals ' +
      'deductions the law actually allows. Post-TCJA, entertainment is dead ' +
      '(§274(a)) but business meals survive at 50% (§274(n)), and several ' +
      'categories remain 100% deductible under the §274(e) exceptions — ' +
      'company-wide recreational events for non-highly-compensated employees, ' +
      'food and beverages sold to customers, and items made available to the ' +
      'general public. In practice, books lump everything into one "Meals & ' +
      'Entertainment" account: 100% items get haircut to 50%, deductible meals ' +
      'get buried with nondeductible entertainment, and undocumented meals get ' +
      'conceded on exam. The fix is three or four separate accounts, a receipt ' +
      'habit that records who and why, and a year-end reclassification review.',
    mechanics: [
      'Entertainment is nondeductible (§274(a)(1), post-TCJA): club dues, ' +
      'tickets, golf, suites. Food and beverages AT an entertainment event ' +
      'remain 50% deductible only if purchased separately or separately stated ' +
      'on the invoice (Reg. §1.274-11).',
      'Business meals: 50% deductible (§274(n)(1)) when not lavish, the ' +
      'taxpayer or an employee is present, and provided to a business ' +
      'associate — client, customer, supplier, employee (Reg. §1.274-12; ' +
      'Notice 2018-76 confirmed client meals survived the TCJA).',
      '100% categories via §274(n)(2)/§274(e): recreational/social events ' +
      'primarily for the benefit of non-highly-compensated employees (holiday ' +
      'party, summer picnic — §274(e)(4)); food/beverages sold to customers ' +
      'for adequate consideration (§274(e)(8)); items available to the general ' +
      'public (§274(e)(7)); meals treated as W-2 compensation (§274(e)(2)).',
      'The bookkeeping failure mode: one blended account means the preparer ' +
      'applies 50% to everything — silently forfeiting half of every 100% item ' +
      '— or deducts entertainment that should be added back.',
      'Substantiation (§274(d) principles carried into the meals regs): amount, ' +
      'date, place, business purpose, and business relationship of attendees. ' +
      'A credit-card statement alone fails; a receipt annotated "lunch w/ Smith ' +
      're: Q3 contract" passes.',
      '2026 note: TCJA\'s scheduled disallowance of employer-operated eating ' +
      'facility costs and §119 convenience-of-employer meals takes effect for ' +
      'amounts paid after 12/31/2025 (§274(o)) — clients with on-site meal ' +
      'programs need those costs reviewed separately. OBBBA added two ' +
      'exceptions: businesses that sell meals to customers (restaurants, ' +
      'caterers — the food-sold-to-customers exception, Reg. ' +
      '§1.274-12(c)(2)(v)) keep the deduction for meals they provide to staff, ' +
      'and so do fishing boats and fish processing facilities (§274(n)(2)(C)).'

    risks: [

      'The tax rules for meals are fussy: taking a client to lunch is 50% deductible, the office holiday party is 100% deductible, and sports tickets are 0% deductible. But most businesses throw all of it into one "meals and entertainment" pile in their books. When everything is in one pile, the safe move at tax time is to cut it all in half — which means the fully deductible items lose half their value, every single year.',
      'The fix is simple and permanent: we split your books into the right categories, give you a ten-second receipt habit (snap a photo, note who you were with and why), and review the coding at year end. Fully deductible costs get counted in full, and every meal deduction you claim has the paper trail the IRS expects.',
