    summary:
      'The owner sells appreciating assets (business interests, real estate) to ' +
      'an intentionally defective grantor trust in exchange for an installment ' +
      'note bearing interest at the AFR. Because the trust is a grantor trust ' +
      'for income tax but outside the estate for transfer tax, the sale is a ' +
      'non-event for income tax — Rev. Rul. 85-13 treats grantor and trust as ' +
      'the same taxpayer, so no gain on the sale and note interest is neither ' +
      'income nor deduction. The estate value is FROZEN at the note; all ' +
      'appreciation above the AFR accrues to the trust beneficiaries transfer-' +
      'tax-free, and the grantor\'s continued payment of the trust\'s income tax ' +
      'is an additional tax-free wealth shift (Rev. Rul. 2004-64). OBBBA\'s ' +
      'permanent $15M exemption reduces the urgency for mid-size estates, but ' +
      'freezing remains valuable for high-growth assets that will outrun even ' +
      'the indexed exemption. Trade-off: assets sold to the trust take carryover ' +
      'basis — no §1014 step-up at death (Rev. Rul. 2023-2 confirms no step-up ' +
      'for non-includible grantor trust assets) — so low-basis assets carry a ' +
      'built-in income tax cost the freeze must outweigh.',
    mechanics: [
      'Structure: grantor creates the IDGT with a deliberate grantor-trust ' +
      'trigger (commonly the §675(4)(C) power to substitute assets) that makes ' +
      'the trust "defective" for income tax while keeping it out of the gross ' +
      'estate.',
      'Seed gift: the trust is funded with a gift — customarily around 10% of ' +
      'the intended purchase price — so the trust has independent substance and ' +
      'the note is respected as debt rather than a retained equity interest ' +
      '(a §2036 inclusion risk if the trust is a mere shell).',
      'The sale: assets are sold at appraised fair market value for an ' +
      'installment note at the applicable federal rate (§1274(d) / §7872). ' +
      'Interest-only with a balloon is common. No gain is recognized and no ' +
      'interest income/deduction arises while grantor status holds ' +
      '(Rev. Rul. 85-13).',
      'The freeze: the estate holds a note fixed at principal + AFR; growth ' +
      'above the AFR accumulates in the trust for the beneficiaries. With ' +
      'discounted valuations of minority/nonvoting interests, the shifted ' +
      'value can substantially exceed the nominal note.',
      'The tax "burn": the grantor pays income tax on all trust income — not ' +
      'a gift (Rev. Rul. 2004-64) — shrinking the taxable estate further while ' +
      'the trust compounds pre-tax.',
      'Basis trade-off: trust assets keep carryover basis; if grantor status ' +
      'ends or death occurs, planning is needed (note balance vs. remaining ' +
      'basis). The substitution power is the repair tool, and the direction ' +
      'matters: the grantor puts cash or HIGH-basis assets INTO the trust and ' +
      'takes the trust\'s LOW-basis assets back in exchange, at equal value. ' +
      'The low-basis assets are then in the estate and get the §1014 step-up ' +
      'at death; the trust is left holding assets with little built-in gain.',
      'California property tax: a sale or gift of California real estate to ' +
      'an irrevocable trust for the children is a change in ownership. Since ' +
      'Proposition 19 the parent-child exclusion covers only a home the child ' +
      'occupies as a principal residence (within a value cap) and family ' +
      'farms, so a rental or commercial building sold to the trust is ' +
      'reassessed to market value. Selling INTERESTS in an entity that owns ' +
      'the real estate avoids immediate reassessment only while no one ' +
      'person acquires more than 50% and cumulative transfers of original ' +
      'co-owner interests stay at or under 50% (R&TC §64(c), (d)). A later ' +
      'swap of real estate back to the grantor is another transfer to test.'

    requirements: [
      'An estate realistically expected to exceed the $15M/person (indexed) exemption — or high-growth assets on a path to exceed it.',
      'A qualified appraisal of the assets sold (business valuation with any minority/marketability discounts defensibly supported).',
      'A seed gift (~10% of the purchase price is the customary practice benchmark, not a statutory safe harbor) reported on a gift tax return with adequate disclosure.',
      'A real note: AFR or better, enforced payment schedule, and actual payments made — serviced by trust cash flow (distributions from the business interest sold).',
      'Estate counsel drafting the trust; this is a coordinated attorney/CPA/appraiser project.'

    risks: [
      '§2036 inclusion if the trust lacks substance (thin seed, missed payments, retained control) — the entire asset returns to the estate at date-of-death value.',
      'Valuation exam risk: discounts on closely-held interests are the primary IRS attack; adequate-disclosure gift reporting starts the statute of limitations.',
      'Carryover basis: heirs inherit the trust\'s low basis — for low-basis, low-growth assets the lost §1014 step-up can exceed the estate tax saved. Model both taxes before committing.',
      'Death before the note is repaid creates unsettled income-tax questions on the unpaid note — structure to retire the note during life where possible.',
      'California real estate sold to the trust is reassessed for property tax (Prop 19) unless it is held in an entity and the 50% tests are respected — on a long-held building the added property tax can rival the estate tax saved.',
      'Grantor status must be maintained (and the income tax burn afforded) — turning it off mid-stream can trigger gain to the extent the note exceeds basis.',
      'OBBBA\'s permanent exemption means a freeze sized for the old sunset math may be unnecessary complexity for estates under ~$30M (married) — rerun the numbers before recommending.'

    bestFit: [
      'Owners of rapidly appreciating businesses or real estate whose estates will exceed the exemption despite its permanence.',
      'Clients with cash-flowing assets that can service the note (distributions cover interest).',
      'Families already committed to succession — the trust doubles as the governance vehicle for the next generation.',
      'Clients who can comfortably keep paying the trust\'s income tax (the burn is a feature, not a bug).'

    implementation: [
      'Model the estate with and without the freeze — including the lost step-up on carryover-basis assets — before engaging counsel.',
      'Estate counsel drafts the IDGT with the chosen grantor trigger; obtain the appraisal.',
      'Make and report the seed gift (Form 709 with adequate disclosure).',
      'Close the sale: note at AFR, security agreement, and a payment calendar the trustee actually follows.',
      'Annually: confirm note payments, revisit the swap power for basis management (cash or high-basis assets in, low-basis assets out), and re-run the estate projection as the exemption indexes.',

      'If your business or property is growing fast, the estate tax problem isn\'t what it\'s worth today — it\'s what it will be worth when you\'re gone. This strategy freezes the value the estate tax ever sees at today\'s number, so all the future growth happens outside your estate, for your family\'s benefit.',
      'Here\'s the shape of it: you set up a special family trust and sell your business interest to it in exchange for a promissory note. Because of how the trust is designed, the sale itself triggers no income tax. Your estate now holds a note worth today\'s value; the business and everything it becomes belongs to the trust for your children.',
      'There\'s a quiet second benefit: you keep paying the income tax on what the trust earns, which the IRS does not treat as a gift. Every tax payment you make shrinks your taxable estate a little more while the trust grows untouched.'

      'This is a real transaction with real paperwork — the trust must be properly funded and the note actually paid, every year.',
      'For California real estate, selling it to the trust can trigger a property tax reassessment at today\'s value. We work out that cost, and whether holding the property through a company avoids it, before anything is signed.'
