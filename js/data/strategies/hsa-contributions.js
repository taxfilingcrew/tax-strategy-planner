    summary:
      'Health Savings Accounts under §223 are the only triple-tax-advantaged ' +
      'vehicle in the Code: contributions are deductible above the line (or ' +
      'pre-FICA through a cafeteria plan), growth is tax-free, and qualified ' +
      'medical distributions are tax-free. 2026 limits (Rev. Proc. 2025-19): ' +
      '$4,400 self-only / $8,750 family, plus a $1,000 catch-up for each spouse ' +
      'age 55+. Eligibility requires HDHP coverage and no disqualifying ' +
      'coverage. OBBBA expanded HDHP eligibility beginning in 2026 — bronze and ' +
      'catastrophic exchange plans are treated as HDHPs, and direct primary ' +
      'care arrangements within monthly fee limits no longer disqualify the ' +
      'account holder. After 65, the account doubles as a supplemental ' +
      'retirement account (non-medical withdrawals taxed like an IRA, no penalty).',
    mechanics: [
      'Deduction is above the line under §223 (Form 8889) — reduces AGI ' +
      'regardless of itemizing. Contributions routed through an employer ' +
      '§125 cafeteria plan additionally escape FICA.',
      'Eligibility (§223(c)): covered by an HDHP on the first of the month, no ' +
      'other non-HDHP coverage, not enrolled in Medicare, not claimable as a ' +
      'dependent. General-purpose health FSA coverage (including a spouse\'s) ' +
      'is disqualifying.',
      'The $1,000 age-55 catch-up is per individual — a 55+ spouse needs their ' +
      'OWN HSA to make a catch-up contribution; it cannot go into the other ' +
      'spouse\'s account.',
      'Last-month rule (§223(b)(8)): eligible on December 1 = treated as ' +
      'eligible all year for the full limit, subject to a 13-month testing ' +
      'period with income inclusion plus 10% recapture if failed.',
      'No use-it-or-lose-it: funds roll over indefinitely and are investable. ' +
      'The max-value play is paying current medical costs out of pocket, ' +
      'keeping receipts, and letting the HSA compound — reimbursement has no ' +
      'deadline.',
      'Contribution deadline is the unextended filing deadline (April 15) for ' +
      'the prior year.'
