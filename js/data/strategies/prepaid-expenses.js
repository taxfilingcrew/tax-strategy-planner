    summary:
      'Under the 12-month rule of Reg. §1.263(a)-4(f), a payment creating a ' +
      'right or benefit that does not extend beyond the earlier of 12 months ' +
      'or the end of the following tax year need not be capitalized. A ' +
      'cash-method business that prepays January–December insurance, rent, ' +
      'software subscriptions, or service contracts in December deducts the ' +
      'full payment this year. The benefit is a ONE-TIME acceleration: once ' +
      'adopted, each year\'s prepayment replaces the deduction it pulled ' +
      'forward, so steady-state deductions are unchanged — and unwinding the ' +
      'practice produces a lean year. Accrual-method taxpayers need the ' +
      'recurring-item exception and economic performance analysis; the clean ' +
      'play is cash-method.',
    mechanics: [
      '12-month rule (Reg. §1.263(a)-4(f)): no capitalization required where ' +
      'the right or benefit ends by the EARLIER of (i) 12 months after the ' +
      'first date the taxpayer realizes the benefit or (ii) the end of the ' +
      'tax year following the payment year. A December 2026 payment for ' +
      'coverage through December 2027 qualifies; a payment for an 18-month ' +
      'policy does not.',
      'Cash-method taxpayers deduct when paid (Reg. §1.461-1(a)(1)) — the ' +
      '12-month rule removes the capitalization objection, completing the ' +
      'current-year deduction. The Ninth Circuit blessed prepaid rent within ' +
      'this window in Zaninovich.',
      'Best candidates: business insurance premiums, rent (12 months max), ' +
      'software/SaaS subscriptions, maintenance contracts, professional dues, ' +
      'bonded warehouse/storage contracts. NOT inventory, and not interest ' +
      '(§461(g) requires interest to be spread).',
      'Accrual-method taxpayers must also clear economic performance: the ' +
      'recurring-item exception (§461(h)(3); Reg. §1.461-5) covers recurring ' +
      'items like insurance where economic performance occurs within 8.5 ' +
      'months, paired with the 3.5-month rule for prepaid services in some cases.',
      'The acceleration is one-time: in year one the business deducts ~24 ' +
      'months of these costs (the normal 12 plus next year\'s 12 prepaid). ' +
      'Every later year deducts a normal 12 (each December prepays the next ' +
      'year). Stopping the practice produces a year with ~0 months of ' +
      'deduction for those items — model and disclose that.',
      'Consistent treatment is a method of accounting — adopting prepayment ' +
      'deductions after previously capitalizing may require a Form 3115 ' +
      'automatic change (Rev. Proc. 2015-13 procedures).'

      'Here is the honest part: it works its magic once. After the first year, each December\'s prepayment simply replaces the deduction you moved up, so future years look normal. It is a timing tool — best used in a year when your income, and your tax rate, are unusually high.'
