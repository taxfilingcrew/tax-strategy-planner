      'When you buy a rental or commercial building, the IRS normally lets you deduct its cost a little at a time — over 27.5 years (residential) or 39 years (commercial). But a building is not just walls: it is carpet, cabinets, appliances, parking lots, and landscaping, and the tax law lets those items be written off much faster — in as little as one year.',
      'A cost segregation study is a detailed engineering report that identifies exactly which parts of your property qualify for the faster write-off. Under current law, most of those parts can be deducted 100% in the first year.',
