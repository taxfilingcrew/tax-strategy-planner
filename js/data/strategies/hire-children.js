    summary:
      'Wages paid to the owner\'s child under age 18 by a parent\'s sole ' +
      'proprietorship (or a partnership in which each partner is a parent of ' +
      'the child) are exempt from FICA under §3121(b)(3)(A), and exempt from ' +
      'FUTA until age 21 under §3306(c)(5). The wages are deductible under ' +
      '§162 against Schedule C profit — which simultaneously removes the same ' +
      'dollars from the parent\'s SE tax base — while the child reports the ' +
      'wages as earned income sheltered by their own standard deduction ' +
      '($16,100 in 2026 under §63(c)(5)(B), since the standard deduction for a ' +
      'dependent extends to earned income plus a small add-on). Wages up to ' +
      'that amount produce zero income tax to the child and zero payroll tax ' +
      'on either side. The entire structure depends on the work being bona ' +
      'fide, age-appropriate, documented, and paid at market rate.',
    mechanics: [
      'Deduction side: wages are an ordinary and necessary §162 expense of ' +
      'the Schedule C business, reducing both income tax and — because they ' +
      'reduce net SE earnings — the parent\'s §1401 SE tax. That double ' +
      'effect is the core of the arithmetic.',
      'Payroll tax side: §3121(b)(3)(A) excludes from FICA "employment" the ' +
      'services of a child under 18 in the employ of a parent (sole prop, or ' +
      'a partnership where every partner is a parent of the child). ' +
      '§3306(c)(5) gives the parallel FUTA exemption through age 20.',
      'Child\'s side: §73(a) taxes compensation for a child\'s services to ' +
      'the child, not the parent. Because wages are EARNED income, the ' +
      'dependent standard deduction under §63(c)(5)(B) covers them up to the ' +
      'full $16,100 (2026) — the child owes no income tax at or below that.',
      'The kiddie tax is irrelevant here: §1(g) applies only to net UNEARNED ' +
      'income; wages are never kiddie-taxed.',
      'The entity form is the gate: an S corporation (or any corporation, or ' +
      'a partnership with a non-parent partner) does NOT qualify for the ' +
      'FICA exemption — the corporation is the employer, not the parent. A ' +
      'Family Management Company structure can restore the exemption for ' +
      'S-corp owners (see that strategy).',
      'The wages fund follow-on planning: the child now has compensation ' +
      'supporting a Roth IRA contribution and, if the plan permits, 401(k) ' +
      'deferrals (see the companion advisory strategies).'

    requirements: [

      'Money routed back to the parent (child\'s "wages" spent by the parent) undermines the bona fides; the child must actually receive and own the funds.',

      'Schedule C owners (or parent-only partnerships) with profit and children roughly 7–17 who can do genuine work.',
      'Parents in high brackets (24%+ plus SE tax) — the rate spread between parent and child drives the benefit.',
      'Families who will redirect the wages into Roth IRAs or 529s, compounding the planning value.'
    ],
    implementation: [
      'Confirm the employer entity qualifies (sole prop / parent-only partnership); if S corp, set up a Family Management Company first.',
      'Write a job description per child; set an hourly market rate with support for it.',
      'Add the child to payroll: W-4, I-9, state new-hire reporting; mark wages FICA-exempt under §3121(b)(3)(A) in the payroll system.',
      'Pay on a regular cadence into the child\'s own account; keep timesheets signed contemporaneously.',
      'Issue a W-2 in January; keep total wages at or below the child\'s standard deduction unless there is a reason to exceed it.',

   * Two payer modes. Kids are always assumed at 0% income tax (default wage

   * 'fmc' — Sole prop / Family Management Company (FICA-EXEMPT wages,
   *   §3121(b)(3)(A)):
   *   • If Schedule C profit exists, the sole prop employs the kids directly:
   *     wages deducted from scheduleCNet, saving income tax AND SE tax.
   *   • Otherwise, if S-corp/K-1 income exists, the FMC flow: the S corp pays
   *     the parents' FMC (a sole prop) a management fee, the FMC pays the
   *     kids, and the FMC's Schedule C nets to ~zero (fee in = wages out).
   *     Modeled as a deduction against passthroughK1 — income shifted out of
   *     the S corp to the kids with NO payroll tax anywhere. Savings = wages
   *     × the parents' marginal rate (the engine computes it exactly,
   *     including the QBI interaction).
   *
   * 'scorp' — the S corporation employs the kids directly. No under-18
   *   exemption inside a corporation: FICA applies. The entity deducts wages
   *   plus its employer FICA half; the kids' employee half is added to the
   *   family's burden via otherTaxes. Net savings = deduction at the parents'
   *   marginal rates minus the 15.3% payroll cost.
