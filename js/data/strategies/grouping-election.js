    summary:
      'Reg. §1.469-4 lets a taxpayer treat multiple trade-or-business or ' +
      'rental activities as a single activity when they form an "appropriate ' +
      'economic unit," judged by five factors (similarities of business, ' +
      'common control, common ownership, geography, and interdependence). ' +
      'Grouping determines WHERE material participation is tested: hours that ' +
      'fall short activity-by-activity can clear the bar for one combined ' +
      'activity. Separately, Reg. §1.469-9(g) lets a real estate professional ' +
      'aggregate ALL rental real estate as one activity. Groupings are ' +
      'binding once made — regrouping is allowed only for material changes or ' +
      'if the original grouping was clearly inappropriate — and Rev. Proc. ' +
      '2010-13 requires disclosure statements for new groupings and changes. ' +
      'CALIFORNIA: the ordinary §1.469-4 grouping carries over to the state ' +
      'return, but the real estate professional rules do not — California ' +
      'does not conform to §469(c)(7), so for California every rental is ' +
      'passive and the §1.469-9(g) aggregation election has no state effect. ' +
      'This is structural: it changes which losses are usable, not the ' +
      'amounts, so it is advisory in this tool.',
    mechanics: [
      'Five-factor "appropriate economic unit" test (Reg. §1.469-4(c)): no ' +
      'single factor controls; a reasonable, consistently applied grouping ' +
      'generally stands.',
      'Strategic effect: material participation hours are counted per ' +
      'ACTIVITY — grouping three related businesses turns 3 × 200 hours ' +
      '(all failing the 500-hour test) into 600 combined hours (passing).',
      'Limits: rental activities generally cannot be grouped with ' +
      'trade-or-business activities unless one is insubstantial relative to ' +
      'the other or ownership is proportionate (Reg. §1.469-4(d)(1)); real ' +
      'property rentals cannot be grouped with personal property rentals.',
      'REPS aggregation (Reg. §1.469-9(g)) is a DIFFERENT election: it treats ' +
      'all rental real estate interests as one activity so a real estate ' +
      'professional tests material participation once across the portfolio.',
      'California: R&TC §17561 does not adopt §469(c)(7). A federal real ' +
      'estate professional\'s rental losses remain passive on the California ' +
      'return (limited to passive income plus the $25,000 allowance, which ' +
      'phases out between $100,000 and $150,000 of income), computed on FTB ' +
      '3801 with separate California carryforwards. The federal aggregation ' +
      'election changes nothing for the state.',
      'Groupings bind future years (Reg. §1.469-4(e)); the IRS can regroup to ' +
      'prevent tax avoidance if the grouping lacks an economic unit (Reg. ' +
      '§1.469-4(f)).',
      'Cut both ways: a grouped activity defers loss recognition on ' +
      'disposition — suspended losses free up only on disposition of ' +
      'SUBSTANTIALLY ALL of the grouped activity (§469(g)).'

    plainEnglish: [
      'The tax law sorts your income into "active" and "passive" buckets, and losses in the passive bucket can\'t offset your regular income. Which bucket an activity lands in depends on how many hours you put into it — measured activity by activity.',
      'Here\'s the catch: if you run three related operations and split your time among them, each one alone might fall short of the hour thresholds, making all of them "passive" — even though you obviously work the combined operation full-time. The fix is an election that tells the IRS to treat related activities as one, so your hours are counted together.',
      'It\'s a structural choice, not a deduction by itself — but it can be the difference between losses you can use this year and losses stuck on a shelf. Because the choice is binding in future years, we model the long-term consequences before filing anything.'
