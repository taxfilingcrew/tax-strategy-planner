    summary:
      'Split the client\'s business into an operating entity (OpCo) and a ' +
      'separate entity holding the real estate or other high-value assets ' +
      '(PropCo), with OpCo paying market-rate rent to PropCo. The rent is ' +
      'deductible to OpCo under §162; the rental income in PropCo is not ' +
      'subject to SE tax — which saves employment tax only where OpCo\'s ' +
      'profit would otherwise bear it (a partnership, or wages from a C ' +
      'corp). An S-corp owner\'s distributions already escape it, and a sole ' +
      'proprietor cannot rent to himself. The self-rental rule (Reg. §1.469-2(f)(6)) ' +
      'recharacterizes net rental INCOME from a materially participating ' +
      'tenant business as nonpassive, so it cannot shelter passive losses — ' +
      'but the structure still delivers liability isolation, income-character ' +
      'flexibility (QBI, SALT/PTET placement), and §1031 optionality on the ' +
      'real estate independent of the business. Value is structural; the ' +
      'dollar effect depends on facts entered elsewhere (see Self-Rental ' +
      'Structuring for the rent-flow math).',
    mechanics: [
      'PropCo (typically an LLC taxed as a partnership or disregarded entity) ' +
      'holds the building/equipment; OpCo (S corp, partnership, or C corp) ' +
      'runs operations and pays market-rate rent under a written lease — ' +
      'deductible under §162 as an ordinary and necessary expense.',
      'Liability isolation: a judgment against the operating business does ' +
      'not reach the real estate, and vice versa — the most valuable asset ' +
      'is walled off from operating risk (slip-and-fall, employment claims, ' +
      'contract disputes).',
      'Income character: rental income in PropCo escapes SE tax (§1402(a)(1)) — ' +
      'a real saving for partners, none for S-corp owners; ' +
      'the self-rental rule (Reg. §1.469-2(f)(6)) makes net rental income from ' +
      'the related operating tenant nonpassive, while self-rental LOSSES stay ' +
      'passive — plan which side of that asymmetry the client lands on.',
      'QBI placement: rental to a commonly controlled trade or business is ' +
      'treated as a trade or business for §199A (Reg. §1.199A-1(b)(14)), and ' +
      'entities can be aggregated under Reg. §1.199A-4 to manage the W-2 ' +
      'wage/UBIA limits. Limits: the rule applies only when the tenant is an ' +
      'individual or pass-through — rent from a commonly owned C corporation ' +
      'does not get it; rent from a commonly owned specified service ' +
      'business is itself SSTB income (Reg. §1.199A-5(c)(2)); and PropCo ' +
      'usually has no W-2 wages, so above the threshold its deduction is ' +
      'capped by 2.5% of the building\'s unadjusted basis unless aggregated.',
      'SALT/PTET flexibility: state PTET elections are made entity by entity — ' +
      'the split lets the advisor route income to the entity where the ' +
      'election (or a state\'s rules) works best.',
      '§1031 optionality: PropCo can exchange the building for replacement ' +
      'property without touching or restructuring the operating business, and ' +
      'the business can be sold someday without forcing a real estate sale ' +
      '(or vice versa).'

    requirements: [
      'A written, market-rate lease between OpCo and PropCo, actually paid and enforced.',
      'Real separateness: separate bank accounts, books, insurance, and observance of entity formalities — the liability shield collapses without them.',
      'Clean title transfer of the property into PropCo (watch transfer taxes, lender due-on-sale/consent, and insurance re-titling).',
      'Coordinated ownership if §469 grouping or §199A aggregation is intended — the elections have common-ownership requirements.'

    risks: [
      'Self-rental asymmetry: net rental income is nonpassive (cannot absorb the client\'s passive losses), but if rent is set to create a loss, that loss is passive and may be trapped — rent-setting is a real planning decision, not a dial.',
      'Non-market rent invites §482-style reallocation and, in a C-corp OpCo, disguised-dividend recharacterization.',
      'Moving an appreciated building OUT of an existing C or S corporation is a taxable event — this structure is far cheaper to build at acquisition than to retrofit.',
      'Transfer frictions: deed transfer taxes and lender consent. California: moving real estate between an owner and an entity (or between entities) is a change in ownership that reassesses the property under Prop 13 unless the proportional-interest exclusion applies (exactly the same owners in the same percentages, R&TC §62(a)(2)); after an excluded transfer, later transfers of more than 50% of the entity interests trigger reassessment (§64(d)). PropCo as an LLC owes $800 a year plus the gross-receipts fee on the rent.',
      'Do not pitch employment-tax savings to an S-corp owner — there are none. For them this structure is about liability and exit flexibility.',
      'Extra compliance: additional returns, leases, and bookkeeping — the benefit must justify the overhead.'

    implementation: [

      'Form PropCo (usually an LLC) BEFORE the property purchase when possible; retrofits need a tax-cost analysis first.',

    plainEnglish: [
      'If your business owns its building — or you are about to buy one — keeping them in the same legal basket is risky. A lawsuit against the business could take the building with it. Splitting them means the business operates in one company and the property sits safely in another.',
      'The business then pays fair-market rent to the property company, just as it would to any landlord. That rent is a normal deductible expense for the business and income to you. If your business is a partnership, the rent also avoids the self-employment tax your share of profit carries; if it is an S corporation, your profits already avoid that tax, so there is no extra tax saving — the reasons to do it are protection and flexibility.',
      'The split also keeps your options open. Someday you might sell the business but keep the building as a rental to the new owner, or trade the building for a bigger one without disturbing the business at all. Separate boxes make both possible.'

      'For partnerships, rent reaches you without self-employment tax (no added saving for S corporations)',

      'There is some added paperwork and cost (an extra tax return, a lease, separate accounts, and in California at least $800 a year for the property company) that the benefits need to outweigh.',
      'In California, re-titling a building can raise its property tax assessment unless the ownership stays exactly the same — we check that before anything is moved.'
