    summary:
      '§179 permits an election to expense the cost of qualifying tangible ' +
      'personal property (and, under §179(e), certain nonresidential real ' +
      'property improvements — roofs, HVAC, fire protection/alarm, and ' +
      'security systems) in the placed-in-service year instead of ' +
      'depreciating it. For 2026 the maximum is $2,560,000, phasing out ' +
      'dollar-for-dollar once total §179 property placed in service exceeds ' +
      '$4,090,000 (OBBBA-raised, indexed). Unlike §168(k) bonus, §179 is ' +
      'elected asset-by-asset and dollar-by-dollar — the cherry-picking tool ' +
      '— but is capped and limited to aggregate active business taxable ' +
      'income under §179(b)(3), with disallowed amounts carrying forward.',
    mechanics: [
      'Election is made on Form 4562, Part I, asset by asset and amount by ' +
      'amount — the taxpayer can expense one machine, half of another, and ' +
      'depreciate the rest. Bonus, by contrast, is all-or-nothing by class.',
      'Eligible property: §1245 tangible personal property used in an active ' +
      'trade or business, off-the-shelf software, and §179(e) qualified real ' +
      'property (roofs, HVAC, fire/alarm, security systems on NONresidential ' +
      'buildings) — items bonus depreciation generally cannot reach because ' +
      'they are 39-year property.',
      'Used property qualifies — acquired by purchase from an unrelated party.',
      'The §179(b)(3) taxable-income limitation caps the deduction at ' +
      'aggregate active-trade-or-business income (including W-2 wages); the ' +
      'excess is not lost but carries forward indefinitely to years with ' +
      'sufficient business income.',
      'For partnerships and S corporations the dollar limit and income limit ' +
      'apply at BOTH the entity and owner level — the deduction passes ' +
      'through separately stated.',
      'Recapture under §179(d)(10) if business use drops to 50% or below ' +
      'during the recovery period.'

      'State nonconformity: several states impose lower §179 limits and require addbacks.',

      'When your business buys equipment, machinery, computers, or even a new roof or HVAC system for a commercial building, the normal rule is to deduct the cost slowly over many years. A special election lets you instead deduct the full cost right away — up to a very generous annual limit.',
      'What makes this election special is control. You pick exactly which purchases to write off immediately and which to spread out, dollar by dollar. That lets us aim your taxable income at precisely the level that saves you the most — not too high, not wastefully low.',

   * Model vs. baseline: baseline is assumed to depreciate the asset straight-

   * depreciation strategy). §179 takes it all in year 1:
   *   Year 1: extra deduction = allowed − (allowed / 7)
   *   Years 2–7: income HIGHER than baseline by allowed / 7; stops after yr 7.
   * The election is capped at the 2026 statutory limit and at the routed
   * income stream (a single-stream simplification of the §179(b)(3) aggregate
   * business-income limit); the excess carryforward is NOT modeled — noted.
   * Routes to scheduleCNet first (also saves SE tax), else passthroughK1.
