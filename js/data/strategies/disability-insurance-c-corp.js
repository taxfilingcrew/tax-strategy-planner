    summary:
      'Disability insurance presents a binary design choice the Code makes ' +
      'explicit: if the employer pays the premiums (excluded from the ' +
      'employee\'s income under §106), any disability benefits are TAXABLE ' +
      'under §105(a); if the employee pays with after-tax dollars (or is ' +
      'imputed the premium as income), benefits are TAX-FREE under ' +
      '§104(a)(3). The premium is small and the potential benefit stream is ' +
      'large — often 60% of salary for years — so the arbitrage almost always ' +
      'favors taxing the premium, not the benefit. For a C-corp ' +
      'owner-employee the clean play is either (a) the corporation pays the ' +
      'premium but reports it as W-2 income to the owner, or (b) an executive ' +
      'bonus (§162 double-bonus) arrangement grossing up the owner to buy the ' +
      'policy personally. Employer-paid group plans can also let employees ' +
      'elect annually between pre-tax and after-tax premium treatment ' +
      '(Rev. Rul. 2004-55). Advisory-only: the value is contingent insurance ' +
      'design, not a computable current-year tax change.',
    mechanics: [
      'The taxation follows the premium: §105(a) taxes benefits attributable ' +
      'to employer contributions not included in the employee\'s income; ' +
      '§104(a)(3) excludes benefits from a policy the employee paid for with ' +
      'after-tax dollars (including employer-paid premiums imputed as W-2 ' +
      'income).',
      'The arbitrage: taxing a ~$3,000 premium costs a high-bracket owner ' +
      '~$1,100/year in federal tax — about $1,400 with California income tax ' +
      '(California follows the same rule: premium taxed, benefits tax-free); ' +
      'NOT doing so puts a potential $150,000/year benefit ' +
      'stream in the taxable column. Insure the disaster, not the premium.',
      'California State Disability Insurance: employees pay SDI on all wages ' +
      '(the wage cap was removed in 2024) and receive a weekly benefit for up ' +
      'to 52 weeks; SDI benefits are not taxable by California and are ' +
      'generally not taxable federally. Private policies usually offset SDI, ' +
      'so size coverage on top of it. A corporate officer who is the sole ' +
      'shareholder (or one of two spouse shareholders) may elect OUT of SDI — ' +
      'check whether the owner did, because then the private policy is the ' +
      'only coverage.',
      'Group policies with mixed employer/employee contributions allocate ' +
      'benefits between taxable and tax-free based on the premium split — ' +
      'for group plans, using a three-year averaging of policy-year ' +
      'contributions under the §105 regulations.',
      'Rev. Rul. 2004-55 blesses plan designs letting each employee elect ' +
      'annually, before the plan year, whether their coverage is employer-paid ' +
      '(pre-tax, taxable benefits) or employee-paid via imputed income ' +
      '(tax-free benefits) — the election controls that year\'s benefit taxation.',
      'Sole proprietors and partners cannot deduct their own disability ' +
      'premiums at all (§262 personal expense; §162(l) covers health, not ' +
      'disability) — but their benefits are correspondingly tax-free under ' +
      '§104(a)(3). The C-corp adds the design choice, plus deductible ' +
      'premiums for rank-and-file coverage.',
      'Benefits paid within FICA\'s six-month rule: employer-funded sick pay ' +
      'is FICA wages for the first six full months after work stops (§3121(a)(4) ' +
      'excludes payments after six months) — factor into net-benefit design.'

    requirements: [
      'A C-corp (or any employer) with the owner as a W-2 employee and an individual or group disability policy in place or being designed.',
      'A deliberate, documented premium-taxation choice: W-2 inclusion of employer-paid premiums, an executive bonus arrangement, or a Rev. Rul. 2004-55 election design — made BEFORE the plan year/benefit event.',
      'Consistency: the W-2 treatment, plan documents, and insurer records must all tell the same story about who paid the premium.',
      'For group plans: written plan terms establishing the contribution structure the benefit-taxation follows.'
    ],
    risks: [
      'The default drift: corporation quietly deducts and excludes the premium for years, then a disability claim arrives and every benefit check is taxable at exactly the moment income has collapsed.',
      'Inconsistent records — deducted premiums but a claimed §104(a)(3) exclusion at benefit time — is an easy IRS win; the exclusion follows what actually happened, not what is convenient later.',
      'Election designs must be adopted before the plan year (Rev. Rul. 2004-55); retroactive recharacterization after a claim fails.',
      'The imputed premium is a real (small) annual tax cost with no visible payoff unless disability strikes — clients need the framing to stick with it.',
      'California: an owner who opted out of SDI has no state benefit underneath the private policy, and an owner who did not is paying SDI on every dollar of wages — either way the coverage amount should be set with SDI in the picture.',
      'Benefit taxation also drives coverage adequacy: a taxable 60%-of-salary benefit nets ~45% or less — size coverage for the after-tax need.'
    ],
    bestFit: [
      'C-corp owner-employees whose income the household actually depends on — the classic overlooked risk for profitable owner-operators.',
      'Professionals with high, hard-to-replace earned income (the benefit stream at stake is large relative to the premium tax).',

    implementation: [
      'Inventory existing disability coverage: who pays, how it is deducted/reported, and what the benefit taxation would be today.',
      'Choose the design: W-2 imputation of corporate-paid premiums, an executive bonus (gross-up) for a personally owned policy, or an annual-election group design.',
      'Paper it: board resolution/plan amendment, payroll coding of the premium, insurer records matching.',
      'Size the benefit to the AFTER-tax need under the chosen design.',
      'Re-verify the payroll treatment each January — this is the strategy a payroll change silently breaks.'

    teaser: 'One paperwork choice today decides whether a six-figure safety net arrives taxed or tax-free',
    headline: 'Make your disability benefits tax-free — before you ever need them',
    plainEnglish: [
      'Disability insurance replaces your paycheck if illness or injury stops you from working. Buried in the tax rules is a simple trade: if the company pays the premium and nobody pays tax on that premium, then any benefit checks are taxable. If the premium is taxed to you now — a small amount — the benefit checks arrive completely tax-free.',
      'Think about the sizes involved. The premium might be a few thousand dollars a year; the tax on it, a few hundred to a thousand. The benefits, if you ever need them, could be tens of thousands of dollars a year for many years — arriving at the exact moment your income has stopped. Paying a little tax on the small number to make the big number tax-free is almost always the right trade.',
      'The catch is that this is decided by how the paperwork is set up before anything happens — how the premium runs through payroll, what the records say. Companies drift into the wrong setup by default because deducting the premium feels like the win. We set it up deliberately, the right way around.'
    ],
    analogy: 'It is like choosing to pay the tax on a seed instead of the harvest. Nobody should pay tax on the harvest — especially a harvest you only collect in a bad year.',
    benefits: [
      'Benefit checks arrive tax-free when you can least afford a tax bill',
      'The cost of getting this right is small — tax on a premium, not on years of benefits',
      'Works through your corporation with a simple payroll adjustment',
      'Also fixes coverage sizing — tax-free benefits mean you may need less coverage'
    ],
    steps: [
      'We review your current disability coverage and how the premiums flow today',
      'We pick the setup that makes your benefits tax-free',
      'We adjust the payroll treatment and document the choice',
      'We re-check it each year so a payroll change never quietly undoes it'
    ],
    considerations: [
      'This means paying a small amount of federal and California tax every year on the premium — the cost of making the big number tax-free.',
      'California\'s own disability program pays a limited weekly benefit for up to a year; we check whether you are covered by it or opted out, and size your private coverage around that.',
      'The choice has to be made before a claim ever happens; it cannot be fixed after the fact.',
      'If employees are covered under a group plan, the design has to handle their side of the same choice fairly.'
