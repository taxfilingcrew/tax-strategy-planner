    summary:
      'When a renovation replaces a building component — a roof, HVAC ' +
      'system, windows, a facade — the owner is usually required to ' +
      'capitalize the NEW component as a restoration, while the OLD ' +
      'component\'s remaining basis keeps depreciating inside the building, ' +
      'invisible. Reg. §1.168(i)-8(d)(2) allows an ELECTION to treat the ' +
      'retirement of the old component as a partial disposition: the ' +
      'taxpayer deducts its remaining adjusted basis as a loss in the ' +
      'renovation year, and — often overlooked — the associated demolition/' +
      'removal costs become currently deductible rather than capitalized ' +
      '(Reg. §1.263(a)-3(g)(2)). The election also purges the old ' +
      'component\'s accumulated depreciation from future §1250 recapture. ' +
      'It is made simply by claiming the loss on the TIMELY return for the ' +
      'year of the disposition — miss the year and the basis stays buried.',
    mechanics: [
      'Trigger: a capitalizable restoration (new roof/HVAC/etc.) that ' +
      'replaces a structural component or a portion of one — the same event ' +
      'that forces capitalization under Reg. §1.263(a)-3(k) opens the ' +
      'partial-disposition election on the retired piece.',
      'The deduction equals the retired component\'s remaining adjusted ' +
      'basis. Where the original cost was never separately stated, the regs ' +
      'permit any reasonable method — including discounting the replacement ' +
      'cost back to the acquisition date (e.g., via the Producer Price ' +
      'Index) and applying the accumulated depreciation ratio.',
      'Removal and demolition costs tied to the disposed component are ' +
      'deducted currently under Reg. §1.263(a)-3(g)(2) when a disposition ' +
      'loss is claimed — frequently worth as much as the basis loss itself.',
      'Recapture cleanup: basis and accumulated depreciation of the retired ' +
      'component leave the fixed-asset ledger, so they never resurface as ' +
      'unrecaptured §1250 gain on sale — a permanent character benefit, not ' +
      'just timing.',
      'Deadline discipline: the election is made by reporting the loss on ' +
      'the timely filed (incl. extensions) ORIGINAL return for the year the ' +
      'component is retired. It is not available retroactively for old ' +
      'renovations absent narrow method-change relief.',
      'A cost segregation study or contractor payment application for the ' +
      'renovation provides the cleanest valuation of the retired component.'

      'When you replace a roof or an HVAC system on a rental or commercial building, the new one gets deducted slowly over many years — the tax law insists. But here\'s what most people miss: the OLD roof you just tore off still has undeducted cost sitting inside your building\'s tax records. Left alone, that leftover cost keeps trickling out over decades — for a roof that\'s in a dumpster.',
      'A special election lets you deduct all of the old component\'s remaining cost in the year you replace it. On top of that, the cost of tearing it out and hauling it away — often a big number by itself — becomes deductible right now instead of being buried in the new roof\'s cost.',
