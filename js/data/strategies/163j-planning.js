    summary:
      'Section 163(j) caps the deduction for business interest expense at ' +
      'business interest income plus 30% of adjusted taxable income (ATI), ' +
      'with disallowed interest carried forward indefinitely. OBBBA ' +
      'permanently restored the EBITDA-based ATI computation — depreciation, ' +
      'amortization, and depletion are added back — which materially raises ' +
      'the cap for capital-intensive borrowers versus the 2022–2024 EBIT ' +
      'regime. Two structural exits exist: the small-business exemption for ' +
      'taxpayers meeting the §448(c) gross-receipts test (average annual gross ' +
      'receipts of $32 million or less over the prior three years for 2026, ' +
      'indexed), and the ' +
      'irrevocable electing-real-property-trade-or-business election, which ' +
      'removes the limit at the price of ADS depreciation (and loss of bonus) ' +
      'on the trade\'s real property. Advisory: whether the limit binds — and ' +
      'which exit is cheapest — requires entity-level computation on Form 8990 ' +
      'that this tool does not attempt.',
    mechanics: [
      'The cap (§163(j)(1)): business interest expense is deductible up to ' +
      'business interest income + 30% of ATI (+ floor-plan financing ' +
      'interest). Disallowed interest carries forward indefinitely ' +
      '(§163(j)(2)); for partnerships the excess interest passes to partners ' +
      'and waits for excess taxable income from the same partnership.',
      'ATI (§163(j)(8)): taxable income computed without business interest ' +
      'income/expense, NOLs, the §199A deduction — and, permanently post-' +
      'OBBBA, without depreciation, amortization, or depletion. The EBITDA ' +
      'add-back is the single biggest lever: heavy depreciation no longer ' +
      'shrinks the interest cap.',
      'Small-business exemption (§163(j)(3)): taxpayers (other than tax ' +
      'shelters) meeting the §448(c) test — average annual gross receipts for ' +
      'the prior 3 years at or below the inflation-adjusted ceiling ($32M for ' +
      '2026, Rev. Proc. 2025-32) — are simply outside ' +
      '§163(j). Aggregation rules (§448(c)(2)) combine commonly controlled ' +
      'entities, so receipts cannot be split away.',
      'Tax-shelter trap: a "syndicate" (>35% of losses allocated to limited ' +
      'owners) is a tax shelter regardless of size and CANNOT use the ' +
      'small-business exemption — loss-year LPs/LLCs with passive owners can ' +
      'stumble into §163(j) unexpectedly.',
      'Electing RPTOB (§163(j)(7)(B)): a real property development, rental, ' +
      'management, or brokerage trade may irrevocably elect out of §163(j); ' +
      'the price is ADS depreciation on its nonresidential real, residential ' +
      'rental, and QIP (longer lives, straight-line, and no bonus on that ' +
      'property). For stabilized, heavily leveraged rentals the trade is often ' +
      'worth it; for assets with big cost-seg/bonus potential it is expensive.',
      'Compliance runs through Form 8990 at the entity level; planning levers ' +
      'are debt placement among aggregated entities and timing income to ' +
      'generate excess taxable income that releases partner-level ' +
      'carryforwards.',
      'Capitalizing interest is NO LONGER a way around the cap. For tax years ' +
      'beginning after 2025, OBBBA applies §163(j) BEFORE the interest ' +
      'capitalization rules: interest a taxpayer elects to capitalize (for ' +
      'example a §266 election on unproductive land) is still business ' +
      'interest tested under the 30% limit, and allowed interest is applied ' +
      'to capitalized amounts first. Only interest that MUST be capitalized ' +
      'under §263A(f) or §263(g) stays outside. Do not recommend a §266 ' +
      'election as §163(j) planning for 2026 or later.',
      'California does not conform to the post-2017 §163(j) limit (SB 711 ' +
      'kept that nonconformity): interest disallowed federally is deductible ' +
      'on the California return in the year it is paid. Track the federal ' +
      'carryforward and the state difference separately.'

    teaser: 'A hidden ceiling can cancel part of your loan-interest write-off — unless you plan around it',
    headline: 'Keep your business loan interest fully deductible',
    plainEnglish: [
      'Most owners assume interest on business loans is automatically deductible. Above a certain size — or in certain structures — it is not. The tax law caps the interest deduction based on a percentage of your business earnings, and any interest over the cap gets pushed into future years instead of helping you now. For businesses carrying real debt — buildings, equipment, an acquisition — that cap can quietly cost real money in a down year.',
      'The good news is there are exits. Smaller businesses — $32 million a year in sales or less, counting related companies together — are exempt from the cap entirely. Real estate businesses can make a special one-time election that removes the cap permanently, though it trades away some faster depreciation write-offs, so it deserves careful math. And recent law changes made the cap itself more generous for businesses with heavy equipment or building depreciation.',
      'Our job is to check whether the ceiling touches you, keep you safely under it where possible, and — if an election makes sense — run the numbers both ways before anything irreversible is signed.'
