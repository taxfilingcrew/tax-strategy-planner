    summary:
      'Qualified Improvement Property — any improvement made by the taxpayer ' +
      'to the INTERIOR of NONresidential real property after the building is ' +
      'first placed in service — is 15-year MACRS property (§168(e)(6), as ' +
      'fixed by the CARES Act after the TCJA drafting error), which makes it ' +
      'eligible for 100% bonus depreciation under §168(k) (permanent under ' +
      'OBBBA for property acquired after 1/19/2025). The practical effect: a ' +
      'tenant buildout, office reconfiguration, or interior renovation that ' +
      'would naively sit on a 39-year schedule can instead be fully deducted ' +
      'in year one — without a cost segregation study, because QIP ' +
      'classification is categorical, not engineering-based. Exclusions are ' +
      'structural: building enlargements, elevators/escalators, and internal ' +
      'structural framework never qualify. This is acceleration against the ' +
      '39-year baseline — the give-back and recapture follow.',
    mechanics: [
      'Definition (§168(e)(6)): improvements to an interior portion of ' +
      'nonresidential real property, placed in service AFTER the building ' +
      'itself was first placed in service, made by the taxpayer. Excluded: ' +
      'enlargement of the building, elevators and escalators, and the ' +
      'internal structural framework.',
      'Classification is categorical: drywall, interior doors, ceilings, ' +
      'interior lighting, plumbing and electrical distribution serving the ' +
      'interior space, flooring, and fire suppression typically qualify — no ' +
      'engineering study required (unlike cost segregation).',
      '15-year recovery, straight-line class — and because the recovery ' +
      'period is ≤ 20 years, QIP is qualified property for 100% bonus under ' +
      '§168(k). One placed-in-service year, one full deduction.',
      'Residential rental interiors do NOT qualify — QIP is a nonresidential ' +
      'concept. Mixed-use buildings need the nonresidential characterization ' +
      'analysis first.',
      'Missed QIP in a prior open year (e.g., depreciated at 39 years) is ' +
      'fixed prospectively via Form 3115 automatic method change with a ' +
      '§481(a) catch-up (Rev. Proc. 2020-25 provided the CARES-era template).',
      'Interaction: electing out of bonus for the 15-year class (§168(k)(7)) ' +
      'leaves QIP on 15-year straight-line — still four times faster than 39 ' +
      'years, useful when a year-one loss would be wasted.'

    plainEnglish: [
      'When you improve the inside of a commercial building — remodeling offices, building out a space for a tenant, upgrading interior lighting or flooring — the default tax schedule spreads that deduction over 39 years. At that pace, a renovation you pay for today is still trickling onto your tax return in the 2060s.',
      'But the tax law puts most interior improvements to commercial buildings in a special fast lane. Instead of 39 years, they qualify for an immediate 100% write-off in the year the work is finished. No engineering study, no special appraisal — the category itself qualifies.',
      'The main rules: it must be interior work on a commercial (not residential) building that was already in use, and things like additions, elevators, and structural framing don\'t count. We check the project scope up front so the invoices tell the right story, and we make sure a deduction this large actually helps you this year — if not, we can deliberately slow it down.'

      'No costly engineering study required — the category qualifies by definition',

    steps: [
      'We review your renovation plans against the qualification rules before work begins',
      'We coordinate with your contractor so bids and invoices separate qualifying work',
      'We model whether the full write-off or a slower schedule saves more, and file the right election',
      'If past renovations were put on the slow schedule by mistake, we can often recover those deductions too'

    considerations: [
      'This front-loads deductions rather than creating new ones — later years have less depreciation, and some is settled up if you sell.',
