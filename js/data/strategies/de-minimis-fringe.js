    summary:
      'Section 132(e) excludes from employee income any property or service ' +
      'whose value is so small, and whose provision is so infrequent, that ' +
      'accounting for it is unreasonable or administratively impracticable — ' +
      'occasional snacks and coffee, holiday gifts of low-value property, ' +
      'occasional meal money for overtime, group meals, flowers for life ' +
      'events. Properly classified, these are tax-free to the employee with ' +
      'zero payroll reporting and deductible to the employer — food and ' +
      'beverages at 50%, not in full (§274(n); the old 100% rule for de ' +
      'minimis meals ended after 2017), other items in full. Two hard edges: ' +
      'CASH and cash equivalents (gift cards) are NEVER de minimis regardless ' +
      'of amount (Reg. §1.132-6(c)), and there is no statutory dollar bright ' +
      'line — frequency and value are judged together. Employer-provided cell ' +
      'phones have their own safe harbor: Notice 2011-72 treats business-' +
      'reason phones (and their personal use) as excludable. Advisory: this is ' +
      'payroll hygiene and audit-proofing, not a modelable deduction — the ' +
      'costs are typically already being deducted; the win is keeping them off W-2s.',
    mechanics: [
      'The test (§132(e)(1); Reg. §1.132-6): value AND frequency both matter — ' +
      'small value provided occasionally is excludable; the same item provided ' +
      'routinely (daily meal money, monthly gift) fails because frequency makes ' +
      'accounting practicable.',
      'Cash rule (Reg. §1.132-6(c)): cash and cash equivalents — gift cards, ' +
      'gift certificates redeemable for general merchandise — are never de ' +
      'minimis. A $15 gift card is W-2 wages; a $15 coffee mug is not. ' +
      '(Occasional meal money/cab fare for overtime is the narrow exception, ' +
      'and it must be occasional.)',
      'No dollar bright line exists in the statute or regs, but the IRS has ' +
      'said where the line is NOT: it has advised that an item worth $100 ' +
      'does not qualify as de minimis (CCA 200108042), and it treated a $35 ' +
      'holiday gift coupon as taxable (TAM 200437030, on the cash-equivalent ' +
      'ground). Keep individual items well under $100 — most practitioners ' +
      'work to $25–$75 — and remember frequency can disqualify even trivial ' +
      'amounts.',
      'Deduction side: coffee, snacks, occasional supper money and group ' +
      'meals for staff are 50% deductible (§274(n)). Company-wide holiday ' +
      'parties and picnics remain 100% deductible (§274(e)(4)), as do ' +
      'non-food items such as flowers and low-value holiday gifts of property.',
      'Cell phones (Notice 2011-72): a phone provided primarily for ' +
      'noncompensatory business reasons (after-hours availability, client ' +
      'contact) is a working-condition fringe and the personal use is de ' +
      'minimis — no logging, no imputation. Reimbursement of employee-owned ' +
      'phones for business reasons gets parallel treatment (IRS field guidance).',
      'Traditional de minimis examples in the regs: occasional typing of ' +
      'personal letters, occasional parties/picnics for employees, occasional ' +
      'supper money, holiday gifts of property with low FMV, coffee/doughnuts/' +
      'soft drinks.',
      'Deduction-side note for 2026: §274(o) makes employer-operated eating ' +
      'facilities and §119 convenience-of-the-employer meals NONDEDUCTIBLE for ' +
      'amounts paid after 12/31/2025. The employee-side §132(e) exclusion is ' +
      'unchanged, but clients running significant on-site meal programs lose ' +
      'the deduction — flag it in planning.'

    risks: [
      'Gift cards are the universal trap — any amount, any occasion, they are W-2 wages, and payroll exams reclassify them across every employee and every open year.',
      'Routine provision destroys the exclusion: daily supper money, a monthly "small" gift, or standing meal allowances are compensation.',
      'There is no safe-harbor dollar amount — advisers who promise "$75 is always fine" are guessing, and the IRS has rejected $100 outright (CCA 200108042); keep value low and frequency genuinely occasional.',
      'Deducting break-room food and staff meals at 100% is a common return error — they are 50% items.',
      'On-site meal programs keep the employee exclusion but lose the employer deduction in 2026 (§274(o)) — budget accordingly.',
      'Perks aimed only at owners look like disguised distributions, not fringe benefits.'

    teaser: 'The small perks you already give can stay off everyone\'s tax forms — if handled right',
    headline: 'Keep the small stuff tax-free — for you and your team',
    plainEnglish: [
      'The tax law has a common-sense rule: perks too small to be worth tracking — coffee and snacks in the break room, an occasional team lunch, flowers when an employee has a baby, a modest holiday gift — do not count as taxable pay. Your business deducts them (food and drinks at half, most other items in full), your employees owe nothing, and nothing touches a W-2.',
      'But there are two tripwires. First, cash and gift cards NEVER qualify — a $20 gift card is legally taxable wages, no matter how small or festive. Second, "occasional" is part of the deal: the same perk given routinely becomes taxable pay. Most businesses stumble on one of these without knowing it, and it surfaces at the worst time — during a payroll audit, multiplied across every employee and every year.',
      'The fix is a simple written policy: which perks you give, how often, and what is off-limits. Ten minutes of structure protects years of goodwill from becoming a payroll problem.'
    ],
    analogy: 'It\'s like the "12 items or fewer" express lane — genuinely small and occasional sails right through, but try to push a full cart through it and the whole arrangement gets pulled aside.',
    benefits: [
      'Team perks that cost you less than equivalent raises or bonuses',
      'Nothing added to W-2s, no payroll tax, no tracking burden',
      'Company phones handled cleanly with one memo',
      'Protection from the gift-card mistake almost every business makes'

    considerations: [
      'Gift cards are the one everyone gets wrong — they are always taxable pay. We will suggest tax-free alternatives your team will like just as much.',
      'These perks must stay small and occasional — regular allowances are pay, and we will be honest about where the line is. There is no official dollar limit, but the IRS has said $100 is too much, so we keep individual items well below that.',
      'Starting in 2026, businesses running full on-site meal programs lose the deduction for them — if that is you, we will plan for it.'
