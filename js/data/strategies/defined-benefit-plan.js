    summary:
      'A qualified plan that promises a future benefit — up to a $290,000 annual ' +
      'life annuity at 2026 limits (§415(b)) — and deducts whatever an actuary ' +
      'certifies is needed to fund it (§404(o)). Because the funding target is a ' +
      'benefit, not a contribution cap, older owners with fewer years to ' +
      'retirement can deduct amounts far beyond any defined-contribution limit: ' +
      'owners in their 50s with high, stable income routinely support $150,000– ' +
      '$300,000+ of annual deductions. The cash balance variant states the ' +
      'benefit as a hypothetical account (pay credit + interest credit), which ' +
      'is easier to communicate and to split among partners. The price of ' +
      'admission is commitment: minimum funding is mandatory each year (§412/' +
      '§430), and the plan needs an enrolled actuary, a TPA, and a multi-year ' +
      'horizon.',
    mechanics: [
      'The actuary works backward from the promised benefit (capped at a ' +
      '$290,000/year annuity at retirement, §415(b)) to a required annual ' +
      'contribution. Less time to retirement = larger required contribution — ' +
      'the design structurally favors owners 45–62.',
      'The deduction follows the actuarial funding math under §404(o), not a ' +
      'percentage-of-compensation cap — this is how deductions exceed the ' +
      '$72,000 DC world by multiples.',
      'Cash balance form: each participant gets a stated pay credit (e.g., ' +
      '$150,000 for the owner, 5% of pay for staff) plus a guaranteed interest ' +
      'credit — a DB plan legally, an "account" visually.',
      'Minimum funding is compulsory (§412/§430): a bad revenue year does not ' +
      'excuse the contribution. Design the pay credit at a level sustainable ' +
      'across the commitment period (typically 3–5+ years to show permanency).',
      'Compensation counted up to $360,000 (§401(a)(17)); benefits above the ' +
      'insured limits of a one-participant plan need PBGC analysis — plans ' +
      'covering only an owner (and spouse) are PBGC-exempt; plans with staff ' +
      'generally pay PBGC premiums.',
      'Self-employed owner: the deduction is above-the-line and reduces §199A ' +
      'QBI — often the point, since it can pull a high earner back under the ' +
      'QBI phase-out threshold.'

    bestFit: [

      'Clients within sight of the §199A phase-out whom a large above-the-line deduction can pull back under the threshold.'
    ],
    implementation: [
      'Commission a design study from an actuary/TPA: census, target deduction, DB-alone vs. combo comparison.',
      'Adopt the plan document by the employer\'s tax filing deadline (SECURE Act retroactive adoption) — but deferral-combo features need calendar-year lead time.',
      'Fund the actuarially certified contribution by the return due date including extensions (no later than 8½ months after year-end for minimum funding).',

      'Deduct: Schedule 1 for a self-employed owner (also reduces QBI); entity return otherwise.',

      'Remember pensions — the retirement plans that promised a guaranteed monthly check for life? Big companies mostly dropped them, but the law still allows them, and a business owner can set one up for themselves. Here is why that matters: the closer you are to retirement, the more the IRS lets you put in to fund that promised benefit — and every dollar is deductible.',
      'While ordinary retirement accounts stop you at $72,000 a year, a pension plan is based on the benefit you are promised at retirement. For an owner in their 50s with strong income, that math often supports putting away $150,000 to $300,000 or more every single year, all deducted from your taxable income.',
      'The trade-off is commitment. This is not an account you fund when you feel like it — the contribution is required every year for several years, and a professional called an actuary calculates the exact amount. That is why we only recommend it when your income is strong and steady.'
