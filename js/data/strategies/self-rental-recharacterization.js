    summary:
      'Reg. §1.469-2(f)(6) recharacterizes NET INCOME from renting property ' +
      'to a trade or business in which the taxpayer materially participates ' +
      'as NONPASSIVE — while net LOSSES from the same arrangement stay ' +
      'passive. The asymmetry is deliberate and one-directional: a client ' +
      'who owns the building their S corp operates from cannot use ' +
      'self-rental income to absorb passive losses from other investments, ' +
      'but a loss on the same building is trapped in the passive bucket. ' +
      'Courts have uniformly upheld the rule (Krukowski, 7th Cir. 2002). ' +
      'Planning is therefore about structure and rent-setting within ' +
      'arm\'s-length bounds: grouping the rental with the operating business ' +
      'under Reg. §1.469-4(d)(1), calibrating rent so the rental neither ' +
      'strands losses nor manufactures phantom nonpassive income, and ' +
      'sequencing depreciation strategies (cost segregation on a self-rented ' +
      'building creates a PASSIVE loss unless grouped). Advisory: the value ' +
      'is avoiding mispriced structures, not a computable deduction.',
    mechanics: [
      'The rule: rent property to a business in which you (or your spouse) ' +
      'materially participate → net rental INCOME is recharacterized ' +
      'nonpassive; net rental LOSS remains passive (Reg. §1.469-2(f)(6), ' +
      'the "self-rental rule").',
      'Why it exists: without it, owners would set above-market rent to ' +
      'their own company to generate passive income absorbing unrelated ' +
      'passive losses. The recharacterization closes that door in one ' +
      'direction only.',
      'The trap: cost segregation or heavy repairs on a self-rented building ' +
      'produce a passive loss that cannot offset the owner\'s (nonpassive) ' +
      'business income — unless the rental and the business are properly ' +
      'grouped as one activity under Reg. §1.469-4(d)(1) (allowed where the ' +
      'ownership of the rental and the business is proportionate, or one is ' +
      'insubstantial).',
      'The grouping fix does NOT work when the tenant is a C corporation: an ' +
      'activity conducted through a C corporation can be grouped with the ' +
      'owner\'s other activity only to test material participation in that ' +
      'other activity, not to merge the rental into the business (Reg. ' +
      '§1.469-4(d)(5)(ii)). So a rental LOSS stays passive, while rental ' +
      'INCOME from the same building is still nonpassive: the self-rental ' +
      'rule applies to a C-corp tenant the owner works in (Williams v. ' +
      'Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2015-76, affirmed by the Fifth Circuit). ' +
      'With a C-corp tenant the only levers are the rent level and timing of ' +
      'depreciation.',
      'Rent-setting levers (within arm\'s-length bounds, supported by ' +
      'comparables): lower rent shifts income into the operating business ' +
      '(QBI-eligible, but SE/payroll-relevant); higher rent shifts income to ' +
      'the rental side where it is nonpassive but escapes SE tax. §482-style ' +
      'reasonableness discipline applies practically at exam.',
      'A self-rental with net income generally still qualifies for §199A QBI ' +
      'via the common-ownership aggregation/trade-or-business analysis (Reg. ' +
      '§1.199A-1(b)(14) treats rentals to a 50%-commonly-controlled business ' +
      'as a trade or business). Three limits: the rule applies only when the ' +
      'tenant is an individual or a pass-through entity — rent from the ' +
      'owner\'s C corporation does not qualify under it; rent from a commonly ' +
      'owned specified service business is itself SSTB income and gets no ' +
      'deduction above the threshold (Reg. §1.199A-5(c)(2)); and a building ' +
      'entity with no payroll is limited above the threshold to 2.5% of the ' +
      'property\'s unadjusted basis unless aggregated with the tenant.',
      'Written leases, market-rate documentation, and consistent treatment ' +
      'year to year are the exam defense.'

    plainEnglish: [
      'Many business owners own their building personally and rent it to their company — smart for liability protection. But a special tax rule applies: if the building makes money, the IRS counts that profit as "active" income; if it loses money, the loss is "passive" and usually can\'t offset your other income. Heads they win, tails you lose.',
      'This one-way rule catches owners by surprise in two situations. First, if you were counting on the rent income to soak up losses from other investments — it can\'t. Second, if you spend big on the building (renovations, accelerated depreciation), the resulting loss can get stuck in a bucket where it does you no good.',
      'The good news: with the right setup — often a simple election that treats the building and the business as one — and rent set at a documented market rate, the rule stops working against you. The key is arranging things before the big deductions happen, not after.'
