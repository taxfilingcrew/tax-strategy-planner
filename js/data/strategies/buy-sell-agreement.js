    summary:
      'A binding buy-sell agreement fixes what happens to an owner\'s equity at ' +
      'death, disability, or exit, funded with life insurance so the buyout cash ' +
      'exists exactly when it is needed. Death proceeds are income-tax-free under ' +
      '§101(a), and a properly drafted agreement meeting §2703 standards can fix ' +
      'the estate-tax value of the decedent\'s interest. Structure now matters more ' +
      'than ever: in Connelly v. United States, 602 U.S. 257 (2024), the Supreme ' +
      'Court held that corporate-owned life insurance proceeds INCREASE the ' +
      'estate-tax value of the decedent\'s shares with no offset for the company\'s ' +
      'redemption obligation. Post-Connelly, cross-purchase and special-purpose ' +
      'insurance-LLC structures are generally preferred over entity redemptions.',
    mechanics: [
      'Entity-purchase (redemption): the company owns policies on each owner and ' +
      'redeems the decedent\'s interest. Simple (one policy per owner), but after ' +
      'Connelly the proceeds are a corporate asset that inflates the value of the ' +
      'decedent\'s shares — the redemption obligation is NOT a liability offset — ' +
      'and surviving owners get no basis step-up in their retained shares (their ' +
      'percentage simply grows).',
      'Cross-purchase: each owner personally owns policies on the others and buys ' +
      'the decedent\'s interest directly. Proceeds never sit inside the entity ' +
      '(no Connelly inflation), and buyers take cost basis in the purchased ' +
      'interest. Drawback: n owners need n×(n−1) policies, and premium burden ' +
      'follows age/health disparities.',
      'Special-purpose insurance LLC: a partnership-taxed LLC owns one policy per ' +
      'owner and effects the cross-purchase — one policy per insured, centralized ' +
      'administration, and transfers of policies among partners fit the ' +
      '§101(a)(2)(B) transfer-for-value exceptions.',
      'Company-owned policies — §101(j): for a policy issued after August 17, ' +
      '2006 and owned by an employer (or a related person) on an employee, ' +
      'officer, director or owner, death proceeds above the premiums paid are ' +
      'TAXABLE INCOME unless (1) BEFORE the policy is issued the insured is ' +
      'told in writing that the business intends to insure him, the maximum ' +
      'face amount, and that the business will be the beneficiary, and ' +
      'consents in writing; and (2) an exception applies (the insured was an ' +
      'employee within 12 months of death or a director or highly compensated ' +
      'employee at issue, or the proceeds go to the insured\'s family or buy ' +
      'the insured\'s interest from them). The business then files Form 8925 ' +
      'every year. A missed notice-and-consent cannot be fixed after issue ' +
      'except by replacing the policy. Applies to entity-redemption plans ' +
      'and, as a precaution, to an insurance LLC.',
      'Death proceeds are excluded from income under §101(a), but a policy ' +
      'transferred for valuable consideration loses the exclusion above basis-plus-' +
      'premiums unless an exception applies (transfer to the insured, to a partner ' +
      'of the insured, to a partnership in which the insured is a partner, or to a ' +
      'corporation in which the insured is a shareholder or officer). Unwinding an ' +
      'old redemption plan by distributing policies to co-owners is where this ' +
      'trap most often springs — note there is NO exception for a transfer to a ' +
      'mere co-shareholder.',
      'For the agreement price to fix estate-tax value, §2703(b) requires a bona ' +
      'fide business arrangement, terms not a device to transfer wealth to family ' +
      'for less than full consideration, and terms comparable to arm\'s-length ' +
      'arrangements. Family-controlled agreements that fail §2703 are ignored for ' +
      'valuation and the estate is stuck proving value the hard way.',
      'Premiums are nondeductible under §264(a)(1) whether the entity or the ' +
      'owners pay them — funding is an after-tax cost weighed against the ' +
      'liquidity and valuation certainty purchased.'
