    summary:
      'Under §453, gain from a sale with at least one payment after the year ' +
      'of sale is recognized proportionally as payments are received — gross ' +
      'profit ratio × each payment. Spreading a large property gain across ' +
      'several years keeps more of it inside the 0%/15% capital-gain ' +
      'brackets, below the NIIT MAGI threshold, and away from bracket-driven ' +
      'phase-outs, rather than stacking the whole gain into one top-rate ' +
      'year. Two hard exceptions drive planning: §1245 depreciation recapture ' +
      'is recognized IN FULL in the year of sale regardless of payments ' +
      '(§453(i)), and large installment balances (> $5M per person) accrue a ' +
      '§453A interest charge on the deferred tax. Installment treatment is ' +
      'automatic; electing OUT under §453(d) is the affirmative choice.',
    mechanics: [
      'Gross profit ratio = gross profit ÷ total contract price; each ' +
      'principal payment recognizes that fraction as gain. Interest on the ' +
      'note is ordinary income (and adequate stated interest is required, or ' +
      '§483/§1274 impute it).',
      'Bracket smoothing is the engine of value: five $60k gain slices can ' +
      'ride the 15% bracket (and stay under the $200k/$250k NIIT threshold) ' +
      'where one $300k slice would push into 20% + 3.8% NIIT.',
      '§453(i): ALL §1245 recapture (e.g., from cost segregation or expensed ' +
      'personalty) is ordinary income in the year of sale even if no cash is ' +
      'received — size the down payment to cover this tax.',
      'Unrecaptured §1250 gain (25% rate) CAN be spread, and under the regs ' +
      'is recognized before the residual capital gain as payments arrive.',
      '§453A: if aggregate installment obligations from sales over $150k ' +
      'exceed $5M outstanding at year-end (per person), interest is charged ' +
      'on the deferred tax liability — the deferral stops being free.',
      'Ineligible: dealer property/inventory, publicly traded securities, and ' +
      'gain cannot be spread to related-party buyers who resell within 2 ' +
      'years (§453(e)). Pledging the note can accelerate gain (§453A(d)).'

    requirements: [

      'A written note with adequate stated interest (AFR minimum) and a real payment schedule.',
      'Creditworthy buyer — the seller is the bank; security (deed of trust, standby letter of credit that is not "payment") matters.',
      'Down payment sized to cover the year-one tax on §1245 recapture recognized up front.'
    ],
    risks: [
      'Buyer default: the remedy is repossession under §1038, but the economics of a failed note can swamp the tax savings.',
      'All recapture tax is due in year one even if little cash arrived — a thin down payment creates a liquidity trap.',

      '§453A interest charge erodes the benefit for balances above $5M.',
      'Related-party sales carry the 2-year resale tripwire and heightened scrutiny.',
      'Death holds no rescue here: unlike appreciated property, an installment note gets NO basis step-up — the deferred gain is income in respect of a decedent to the heirs.'

    bestFit: [
      'Sellers of appreciated rentals, land, or business property whose gain would otherwise stack into the 20% + NIIT range in a single year.',
      'Clients who value ongoing interest income and can tolerate carrying the buyer\'s credit.',

    implementation: [
      'Model the gain both ways — one-year recognition vs. the proposed payment schedule — including NIIT thresholds and the 0/15/20 breakpoints.',
      'Compute §1245 recapture separately and set the down payment to cover the year-one tax.',
      'Paper the note: AFR-compliant interest, amortization schedule, security instrument.',
      'File Form 6252 for the sale year and each collection year; report interest separately.',

      'When you sell a property for a large profit and take the whole price up front, the entire gain lands in one tax year — often pushing you into the highest capital-gain rate plus an extra investment-income surtax. The tax system punishes lumpy income.',
      'An installment sale means the buyer pays you over several years, and you pay tax only as the money arrives. Each year\'s slice of gain is smaller, so more of it is taxed at lower rates — sometimes dramatically lower. You also collect interest from the buyer along the way, like being the bank.',
      'There are two things to plan around: any portion of your past depreciation that the IRS "recaptures" is taxed in the first year no matter what, and you\'re trusting the buyer to keep paying. We structure the down payment and the security so both risks are covered before you sign.'
